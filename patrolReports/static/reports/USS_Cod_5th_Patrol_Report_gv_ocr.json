They started going off six minutes\nafter firing and there were only eight charges\ndropped, but the next hour was the most harrowing\nof my experience. There was a nine degree\nnegative gradient starting at 235 ft., and we\ngot under it in 1 minute and 42 seconds, slowed\nto 50 turns and commenced evasi ve tactics.\nThere were two sets of screws, one fast and one\nslow. They would ping and listen. I tried to\nput them astern; sometimes we would get one\nback on the quarter, only to have him make a\nrun across to our other bow, passing ahead or\ndirectly over. They stayed one on either bow\nmost of the time, and would turn and make their\nruns over to the other side. I have spent many\nhours in the A/S attack teachers at CUA and\nEFATZ, and many of the runs this night were good.\nThe re were some runs without sufficient lead\nangle, when the A/S vessel would pass directly\noverhead, but these only added to the discomfort.\nAt one ti me the raneuvering room reported our\nport screw making a \"squishing\" sound. This\nturned out to be the slow speed escort passing\noverhead. On another occasion both vessels were\nmilling about overhead and I thought surely they\nmust be using a depth finder. And all of this\nwas carried on in the utmost silence. Not a\ncharge was dropped after the first two-minute\nbarrage. It is impossible to describe the ten-\nsion attached to listening for the charges when\nyou know that the scoundrel is in a good dropping\npositi on and he does not drop. I could not\nbelieve that they could hear us through the\ngradient, yet I could not understand why their\nsearch did not take them farther afield.

The nearest and\nlargest ship was plainly visible as a large\ntwo-stack transport. After thirty minutes of\ntracking and while we were working up ahead,\nthe targets commenced making 60 degree zigs,\nstill at five minute intervals. In these\nmaneuvers, the transport pulled away to the\nweatward from the other ships, getting out of\nvisual distance (unaided by binoculars). We\nwere thrown on the port bow of the transport,\nseparated from all but one escort, so I picked\nthe transport as our target. Lade tubes ready\nexcept for outer doors and closed track.

The slow progress through the water at\nthis speed limited our tactics to maneuvers with\nthe rudder to put the A/S vessels astern.\n(K) MAJOR DEFECTS AND DAMAGE\n1. Bow Plane Rigging Casualty:\nOn 25 September 1944, while making 11.5\nknots on the surface, the bow planes, having been\nrigged out, failed to rig in completely. On attempting\nto rig them in a second time a fire broke out in\nthe rigging panel caused by an overload. Investi-\ngation showed the overload to be me chanical and not\nelectrical. The gear casing in the forward torpedo\nroom was found to be unduly hot (about 135°) and\nthe oil in the gear casing was omulsified. The oil\nwas drained out and the gear casing flushed with new\noil; on flushing, part of a six penny neil was found\nin the drain. The lower half of the gear casing vms\nremoved and one-fourth inch of bronze filings and\nsludge was found in the casing. The steel worm gear\nhad cut about 1/32\" on the bronze bull gear and the\nteeth on both gears were rough. The bull gear was\nground smooth in place; the worm gear was smoo the d\nin a lathe. All bearings in the casing showed ex-\ncessive rust; the forward worm gear bearing was re-\nplaced; the re were no replacements available for the\nothers.\nThe gear casing was reassembled and the\nplanes operated. The result was normal line amperage\n(64 amps), cool gear case and less noise.\nThe entire bow plane rigging system will\nrequire realignment and replacement of worm and bull\ngear in forward torpedo room gear casing next refit.\n- 69-",
  "71": "CONFIDENTIAL\n2. Casualty to Engine Air Induction Outboard alve:\nOn 26 September 1944 on surfacing the..\nengine air induc ti on cutboard valve failed to open.\nThe oporating gear in the crow's mess\nwas inspected, the moving parts of the operating\nmechanism were caked and nearly frozen with cor-\nrosion. The force required to shut the induction\nafter once opened was beyond the strength of one\nman,\nThe pro sont design of this induction\nvalve inside the hull is of such ann turc that only\ntwo of the pins holding the crosshond linkage can\nbo inspected and worked on submerged. (In the shut\nposition). It would be highly desirable to re-\ndesign the casting or install inspection platos on\nthe casing to enable all three of the pins to be in-\nspected and worked on while submerged.\nThe parts were freed with penetrating\noil, cleaned and completely rerreased. The in-\nduction then operated satisfactorily; however,\nthe ctionis. slightly sluggish.\nComplete overhaul and replacement of\nparts will be required during next refit.\n3.\nBent Depth Sotting Spindle:\nFollowing depth charging on October 8,\n1944, the depth setting spindle in No. 10 tubo was\nfound to be bent upon withdrawing tor podo from tube.\nThe casualty is believed to have been caused by the\nspindle being only partially locked in the disen-\ngaged position, and upon depth charging the spindle\nwas jarred into a partially engaged position. On\nattempting to withdraw the torpedo from the tub the\nspindle wes bent. The bent spindle was replaced\nwith spare and tested satisfactorily.\n4. Bent Gyro Setting Spindle No. 2 Tube:\nThe spindle is believed to have been\nbent as a result of depth charging before the tubo -\nwas secured on October 8, 1944. The spindle housing\nwas removed from the tube, the spindle sloovo checked\nand replaced, the housing renssembled and tested\nsatisfactorily.\n- 70-",
  "72": "CONFIDENTAL\n5. Loss of Hydraulic Oil in Forward Torpedo Room:\nThe jarring during the depth chargo\nattack on October 5, 1944, caused hydraulic oil to be\nblown out of the vent on both wind less capstan vent\nand rep lonishing tank vent and out of the bow plane\nrigging gear case in the forward torpedo room.\"\nNo material damage other than the loss of\noil has as yet been noticed.\n6. Repeated Failure of the DRAI:\nSeveral times during this patrol the\nlongitude indicator of the DRAI has stuck and failed\nto register. The same defect was noted on the last\npatrol and the tender during the last refit failed\nto correct this defect. (It was removed to shop,\ntested and inspected, reinstalled and pronounced\nsatisfactory).\nThe fault apparently is in the friction\ndisc of the longitude input, and since the defect\napparently cannot be remedied by tender force - a\nnew DRAI is desired this coming refit.\n7. Excessive Vibration of Stern Planes:\nEarly during this patrol a growl has\ndeveloped in the stern planes. When moving the planes\nfrom dive to rise or vice versa in power, a growling\nnoise is heard throughout the after torpedo room,\nand the movement of the planes causes the entire ship\nto vibrate. This vibration has become progressively\nmore noti ceable throughout the patrol.\nIt is desired that the ship be docked\nthis refit, the planes inspected outside the hull,\nthe shafting and gearing inspected in order to as-\ncertain the cause and correct the noise and vibra-\ntion. The planes were inspected in SAIPAN, but the\ntrouble could not be located.\n8. Cracked Liner No. 2 Cylinder No. 2 Main Engine:\nOn September 25, 1944, fresh water\npressure on No. 3 Main Engine revealed presence of\nwater in cylinder. The liner was found to be\ncracked, and was replaced with spare.\n- 71-",

The engi ne wes out of\ncommission for a period of 25 hours during the\nexchange of pumps.\nInspection of the old pump showed\npowdering of balls and broken bell race in the\nbearing, this causing the impellor to drop down\nagainst the suction pipe.\n10. Bridge Talk Back Casualty:\nFurther\nOn 13 October 1944, the key on the bridge\nfor the talk back flooded cut. At first it was\nbelieved that the cable packing was faulty but re-\npacking failed to keep water cut of the box.\ninvestigation revealed that the flexible motal dia-\nphragm was cracked at the point where the key lever\ngoes through the diaphragm.\nnew diaphragm was made from shim brass\nand to prevent this casualty from occuring again\nthe diaphragm was not drilled to allow the key lever\nto pass through, but key lover was cut at this point\nand soldered to the diaphragm.\n11. Bow Plane Casualty:\nFollowing depth-charging on October 8,\n1944, the bow planes failed in power and were\nshifted to hand power. Inspection showed a taper\npin on the (\"Rise-Dive\" - \"In-Out\") handle in the\ncontrol room switch box had worked its way loose\nand had fallen out. The pin was replaced and the\nbow planes were put back in the power position,\nno cossitating hand power for about fifteen minutos.\n12.\nBow Plane Casualty:\nOn making a trim divo after leaving\nSAIPAN on the evening of the 8th of November the bow\nplanes failed to tilt in power although the \"cut\"\nlight was showing. Investigation showed that the\n\"out\" limit switch in the forward torpedo ro or had\ntripped before the contact arm connecting the rigging\ncircuit had closed. The planes were shifted to\n-72-",

While\nstill subre rged the planes were rigged in and cut\nseveral times and the contact arm adjusted.\nThree days later on 11 November when\nmaking a trim dive the same casualty occured. It\nis believed the sea slapping the planes as they were\nrigeing out prevented the planes from ging out all\nthe way.\nIn order to properly adjust the cut-out\nlimit switch and contact arm, it was necessary to\nlie to, sond a man topside that night and check the\ncloarances to pside. The limits were then adjusted\nand tosted satisfactorily.\n13. No. 4 Main Generator:\nOn 11/11/44 while operating at 750 KW\non propulsion No. 4 main generator was noticed te\nbe sucking and sparking by the oiler on watch in the\nengine room.\nAnother generator wes inrodiat cly started\nand the lead shifted from No. 4, which was then se-\ncured.\nExamination disclosed a \"flash over\"\ncondition, with molten brush holder retal thrown\naround the end-bell and riding around on the\ncommutator.

The\ncommut tor was badly burnod.\nMolt en bress and piecos of aluminum were\nlaying in the bottom of the casing. One short brush\nwas found thrown out of its holder and laying on a\nlower row of brushes.\nIt is believed that this brush wore down\nuntil the rivet and washer holding the pir tails\nrubbed on the commutator, bridging the slots and\ncreating a short circuiting path with the resulting\nflash over.\nDue to the extent of the dacco to the\ncomutator ropni rs were not attempted. visul in-\nspoction was do and ground readings were taken on\nL\n-73-",

One fuse failure was caused by an arc in the\nline when the power terminal joins the set. The scrow\nholding the terminal on the terminal block was just\nloose enough for a small arc to develop.\nThe carbonization of the insulation on the\nline from the bias resistor (R-39) to the modula tor\nnetwork allowed this line to short out causing gus e\nfailure in one instance.

  "90": "CCFIDENTIAL\n(REMARKS:\nHand-Keying of SJ Radar. Elsewhere I have given full\ncredit to the RAY for his commendable use of the SJ\nradar for the purpose of transmitting important in-\nformation at a time when his radio transmitter was\nout of commission. In the COD we have used the SJ\nfor communication purposes rather frequently during\nthe past two patrols. I vi sh to emphasize that while\nthe SJ is being used for communication purposes, it\ncan not be used for tracking. I look upon the use\nof the SJ for communication, or even for recognition,\nas an indication that we lack the proper tool for the\njob. I am always unwilling to sacrifice even a few\nseconds of valuable search by the SJ radar. Sooner\nor later a boat will be sunk by an enery that he would\nhave destroyed or avoided had he been searching at the\ntime with his SJ. I believe that the TBS, controlled\nfrom Conning Tower or Bridge, would fill a definite\nneed for submarines working on the same target. Thy\nwas it removed? Perhaps the VHF will do equally as\nwell.\nVoice Calls. I have experienced a desire more than\nonce during this patrol, for a permanent system of\nvoice calls for our submarines. As it stands now,\nsubmarines making up a wolf-pack are assi red voice\ncalls by the pack commander. These calls are known\nto themselves and to no one else. When the co casion\narises for impromptu coordination between boats\nassigned to different areas, the need for calls is\nfelt. The name of the commanding officer may be used,\nbut this is not always known. Frequently, the name\nof the other submarine itself is not known, until\ncontact has been made. My suggested solution for\nthis problem is: Let a central authority (ComSubPac\nor the Director of Naval Communications) make up a\nlist of permanent voice calls for all boats built and\nbuilding. Let these calls be phonetically correct\nfor security purposes. Let the re be two or more\nalternate calls for each boat. Let the list be videly\ndisseminated to all submarines and to all fleet force\nand air commanders, so that the calls will not be\nduplicated in the communication plans for operations\nby other forces. Let there be included calls with\nthe following meaning:\nAny allied submarine. Example: RALSTON\nAny allied submarine who is experiencing\nradar interference. Example: RACHEL\n- 89 -",
  "91": "CONFIDENTIAL\nAny allied submarine who is experiencing\nreder interference on approximate\nbeari ng\ntrue from him.\nExample: LULU 150.\nAny allied submarine in vicinity of area\nExample: BULLDOG 49, or\nBULLDOG LUZON STRAIT, or BULLDOG\nBONEYARD, or BULLDOG BOLINAC, etc.\nI can see no necessity for having the calls\nThen frequent shifts\nchange at frequent intervals.\nof voice calls were adopted by the 3rd Flect, it\nseemed to many of us that the resulting confusion\nout weighed any security factor that was attained.\nUse of SD Radar. During the major portion of this\npatrol we keyed the SD radar for five (5) seconds\nout of every thirty (30), night and day. I am unable\nto point to any one plane contact and state that that\nplane was probably attracted to us by the SD. On the\ncontrary, we watched some plenes go by, on the sur-\nface, while the SD was being keyed. But neither am\nI able to state that any one plane was radar equipped\nor was on a definite anti-submarine search mission.\n(Except those planes actually accompanying ships.)\narea.\nIn SAIPAN I talked to at least three sub-\nmarine commanders who did not use the SD at all in the\nConditions are undoubtedly different in EMPIRE\nareas from those existing in the SCUTII EST PACIFIC,\nbut by use of the SD my watch officers and myself have\nfelt a certain measure of security in surface patroll-\ning, and have made ship contacts on the off-shore routes\nthat we would not have made had we restricted our\nday time operations to submerged patrol at the inshore\nfocal points.\nPersonnel. The personnel of this submeri ne remain\nvery agressive. Many of them were anxious to ask\nfor a reload of torpedoes even when it would have en-\ntailed a patrol of more than 100 days. This spirit\nis gratifying.\n- 90 -",
