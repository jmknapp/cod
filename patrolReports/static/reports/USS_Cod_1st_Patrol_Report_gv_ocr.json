  "1": "- 7 USS COD (SS 224)\nfourth war patrol. After fifty-four days on her war patrol COD ar-\nrived at Fremantle, Western Australia on 25 August for a normal refit\nperiod.\nThe submarine departed on her fifth war patrol on 18 September\n1944 which was conducted in the areas west of Luzon and Mindoro. Her\nfirst attack was made on a convoy of one large tanker, one freighter,\ntwo smaller vessels and a WAKATAKE class destroyer escort. Singling\nout the two largest targets, COD fired four torpedoes at the tanker\nand two at the freighter. Two hits were observed on the tanker and\none hit was probably made on the freighter. Observation was interrupted.\nby an aggressive attack by the escort vessel which kept COD submerged\nfor a short while.\nOn coming back to periscope depth, COD noticed that the convoy\nwas still in the vicinity and approached for another attack. The dam-\naged tanker was selected again and four torpedoes were sent on their\nway. All four torpedoes ripped into the tanker and she disappeared.\nTwo days later, a night attack was made on another large tanker\nwhich had already been damaged by a torpedo from the submarine RAY.\nFour torpedoes were fired and two timed hits were made; these hits ***\nwere observed by USS RAY. This attack brought an aggressive anti-\nsubmarine hunt by the escort vessels.\nCOD surfaced about daybreak and noted that the tanker had suffered\nsevere damage but had not sunk. The submarine set chase for the tanker\nbut could not gain a firing position before the tanker reached the\nsafety of shallow water.\nOn 8 October, COD made an approach on a Japanese mine layer at\nperiscope depth. Upon gaining position, she fired a spread of six tor-\npedoes. The enemy spotted the torpedo wakes and made successful eva-\nsive maneuvers. Turning toward the submarine to counter-attack, the\nmine layer forced COD to go deep to avoid the depth charges which fol-\nlowed.\nOn 22 October, COD sighted five enemy sea trucks and made an at-\ntack on them with gun fire. Several hits were scored on one of the\ntrucks before they could escape to safety by running into shallow water.\nA night surface attack was made on a convoy of four large ships\non 25 October. The convoy was heavily escorted by five anti-submarine\nvessels. The largest of the ships, an ASAMA MARU class transport, was\nselected as the target and the last four torpedoes were fired after\nthis fast-moving target from the best position obtainable. Unfortu\nnately, all torpedoes missed even though the firing problem had\nchecked perfectly. The keen disappointment over missing this target\nwas felt throughout the submarine and it was determined that COD would\ntrack this convoy until it could be turned over to another submarine.",
  "2": "- 8 USS COD (SS 224)\nAlthough out of torpedoes herself, COD tracked this important con-\nvoy for about thirty hours. The thought of the American and allied\nsoldiers that might be killed by the enemy troops and equipment in the\nASAMA MARU transport spurred the COD on to follow the convoy and report\nits positions.\nA rendezvous was made with the submarine BREAM on 29 October and\nsix Japanese soldiers were transferred to COD. They had been picked\nup out of the water by BREAM after their transport had been sunk from\nunder them. The prisoners of war were covered with ulcerated wounds,\njungle sores and chancres.\nDuring this war patrol, COD arrived on lifeguard duties off the\nnortheast coast of Luzon during the carrier strikes in the vicinity of\nManila Bay. Upon completion of her fifth war patrol, COD pulled into\nPearl Harbor on 20 November 1944, on her way to the Navy Yard at Mare\nIsland, California, for an overhaul.\nOn 1 December, COD arrived at Mare Island and by 20 February 1945,\nher yard overhaul was completed. Leaving San Francisco, the submarine\narrived at San Diego on 22 February, where she gave daily services to\nthe West Coast Sound School until her departure for Pearl Harbor on\n28 February. COD entered the channel at Pearl Harbor on 7 March where\nshe received voyage repairs and training.\nThe sixth war patrol of the submarine COD started with her depart-\nure from Pearl Harbor on 24 March 1945. COL and the submarine POMPON\ndeparted from Guam together on 9 April to conduct coordinated patrol\nand lifeguard operations for the 5th Air Force in the East China Sea.\nThis patrol was under the command of Commander J. A. Adkins, USN. The\nsubmarines POMPON and COD operated as a coordinated attack group with\nthe Commander Adkins as task group commander.\nIn the late morning of 17 April 1945, two ships were sighted and\nCOD approached them on the surface to engage them with gunfire. Upon\nsurfacing it was apparent that one of the vessels was towing the other.\nThe tow was set on fire with 5-inch and 40 millimeter shells. The tow\nbviously had a cargo of oil as large clouds of black smoke poured out\nind flames engulfed the vessel. The armed tug let go his tow at this\noint and decided to shoot it out.\nThe tug was taken under fire at a range of 3,700 yards and as she\nrew closer she was sunk by the gunfire of COD's 5-inch and 40 milli-\neter shells. COD then returned to the burning oiler and sank it with\nthree five-inch hits along the waterline. Three prisoners were picked\nup from the water.\nOn the evening of 24 April, the submarine made radar contact on\ntwo ships. Gaining a firing position, COD fired four torpedoes at the\nlead ship. Each torpedo jumped out of the water as soon as it was\nlaunched and then proceeded toward the target like a porpoise, alter-\nnately broaching and plunging. The trailing ship was not fired upon",
  "3": "-9 USS COD (SS 224)\nconsidering the performance of the torpedoes and the target ship de-\ntected the submarine and gave chase. The increasing accuracy of the\nenemy's gunfire forced COD to submerge and endure a severe depth\ncharging.\nThe submariners in COD showed their mettle on 26 April when a tor-\npedo casualty and fire occured in the after torpedo room. The crew\nworked heroically as the fire blazed with increasing intensity and\nthreatened to explode the warhead in the torpedo which caused the\ntrouble. Working in intense heat and smoke, the men rigged jiggers\nto the torpedo, which was too hot to touch, and held their thumbs over\nthe hydrogen burner hole in the torpedo tube door during the time when\nthe torpedo was fired. The captain off the ship was deeply impressed\nby the sterling quality of his men and said, \"It is a privilege to\nhave been their shipmate.\"\nDuring this time it was necessary for two men to go aft to assist\nin opening the after torpedo room hatch from topsides. Two of the men\nwere washed over the side, one of whom was recovered some time later\nin a state of complete exhaustion. An intensive search for the other\nman was unsuccessful. A Navy patrol plane assisted in the ecarch for\nan extended period in spite of the foul weather which was considered\nby the skipper of COD to be non-flying weather. He was greatly im-\npressed by the willing risk and dilligence displayed by these flyers\nin helping search for the lost man.\nMany floating mines were sighted during this war patrol and 11\nof them were sunk by gunfire from the sub. Patrol and lifeguard duty\nwas also included in the COD's schedule before she arrived at Guam on\n29 May 1945.\nAfter a normal refit period, COD departed from Apra Harbor, Guam\non her seventh war patrol on 26 June 1945. This patrol was conducted\npartly in lifeguard duties off the Indo-China Coast and partly on of-\nfenisve patrol in the Gulf of Siam. On 9 and 10 July, COD was skill-\nfully maneuvered for 14 hours in close proximity to the grounded Dutch\nsubmarine 0-19 in a vain effort to tow her clear of Ladd Reef. The\ncrew of the Dutch submarine was finally transferred to COD and the\n0-19 was completely destroyed by demolition charges, torpedoes and\ngunfire.\nOn 1 July, COD made an unsuccessful attack on a small convoy.\nThe smooth sea coupled with air cover, forced the submarine to ap-\nproach submerged and just prior to firing, the sub was bombed or depth\ncharged. Three torpedoes were fired on sound bearings but no hits\nwere scored. The Jap counter attack was not too close.\nThat night an end around was made on the same convoy to gain a\nposition ahead. However, on commencing an approach, the radar power\nsupply burned out. The only choice left was to attempt another day-\nlight attack. No further contact with the convoy could be made.",
  "4": "- 10 USS COD (SS 224)\nDuring the period between 21 July and 1 August, CDD made twenty\ngun attacks on twenty-three junks and motor sampans, plus one towed\noil barge, sinking all of them for a total of 2,200 tons sunk. During\nthese attacks 65 rounds of five-inch ammunition and 1,092 rounds of\n40 millimeter ammunition were expended. COD was one of the first ships\nto attempt to break up the considerable ammount of small boat traffic\nin the Gulf of Siam which was transporting valuable enemy cargo in\nsmall lots to and from Singapore. The cargoes consisted of rice, sugar,\noil, soap, crude rubber, coffee, paper, horseshoes and army blankets.\nThe sub's skipper inspected these vcssels to determine the nature of\nthe cargoes and provide for the safety of friendly natives.\nOn 1 August, COD was forced to dive while being strafed by an\nenemy fighter plane, leaving her boarding party unassisted on an enemy\nship. Fortunately the boarding party was rescued by the submarine\nBLENNY after 48 hours. They were in good health and suffered no ill\neffects from their junk cruise.\nThe seventh war patrol was successfully ended as COD pulled into\nFremantle Harbor, Western Australia on 13 August 1945. This completed\nthe submarine's last war patrol in World War II since the cessation of\nhostilities followed, shortly thereafter. COD subscquently returned\nto the United States, where she was placed out of commission in reserve\nin the New London Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet.\nUSS COD (SS 224) earned the Submarine Combat Insignia for each of\nher seven war patrols and is entitled to wear seven Battle Stars on\nthe Asiatic-Pacific Area Service Medal for her service in World War II.\nShe participated in the Okinawa Gunto Operation from 14 April to 25\nMay 1945.\nCOMMANDING OFFICERS\nCommander J.

Attack was completed 15\nminutes after sunri so, about 100 miles from near-\nest known airbase at Puerto Princesa, Palawan Island,\nand presence of aircraft not detected until after\nattack. Destroyer escort made three runs on submarine\ndropping 5 or 6 depth charges. Echo renging was not\nheard. Nogative gradient oxisted at 260 feet.\nEvasive tactics consisted of putting stern toward and\ngoing below layer.\nEnemy convoy contacted in daylight during\nlow and variable visibility had escort stationed\nwe 11 out (4000 yards) on flank.

Not one of the enemy ships\nsighted during this patrol smoked.\n(K) MAJCI DEFECTS AND DAMAGE\nRudder\nDuring patrol a rumbling and groening sound\ndeveloped in the rudder operating shafting, especially\nnoticeable while operating steering by hend. Source\nof noise was localized in that portion of the shaft-\ning connecting the port ram and the rudder crosshead.\nIt is believed that this shafting binds due to faulty\npacking in one of the stuffing tubes in the after\nbulkhead of after trim tank. This noise bocomo s\nprogressively louder as depth is increased, and under\npresent conditions seriously impairs ability of the ship\nto run silent.\nMain Engines\nOn 27 November, main cngine difficulty, ovi-\ndenced by increasingly high exhaust temperatures in\none cylinder unit of #1 main engine, necessitated the\ndecommissioning of this engine for examination and\nrepair. All exhaust valves in this unit were found\nto be badly burned. Compression pressure readings\ncombined with comparative oxhaust temporatures and:\ninjector micrometer settings indicated possibility\n30",

As time and operations permitted,\nvarious units in all ongi nes were inspected and badly\nburnod exhaust velves found in 60 percent of these\nunits. Upon arrival Darwin, decision was made to\nuse #1 main engine in emergencies only, to examine\nand repair all units of #2 and to proceed Fremantle\non the after enginos which were in the best operating\ncondition. As of 8 December 1943 engi no hours were:\n#1-1316; #2-1167; #3-1069; and #4-1042. During the\nperiod between commissioning and departure from\nDerwin on patrol (22 October 1943) main engines\nwere operated at various loads up to and including'\nfull power.\nSince 22 October load has been limited\nto 750 K except for one pori od of approximately 2\nhours when the engines were run at 800 KW. Additional\nreport concerning this material deficiency will be\nmade after further examination of engines during refit.\n(L) RADIO\nRadio recoption throughout the patrol was\nexcellent.

In this case planc wes flying\nclose to the water at an estimated range of 6-7 miles.\nPlanes were reliably detected at ranges greater\nthan 10 miles. Land was usually detected at 35-40\nmiles.
