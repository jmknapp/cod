The shafting to\nthe trining gears was misaligned to the extent that\nabout eight teeth were shoared from the large gear and\nthree from the small gear on tho limit switch gear\nassembly. The heavy jars caused the fan to rub against\nthe field coils and scrape insulation from those coils.\nThe commutator bars were forced back and sanded down to\ncorrect size; this eliminated the sp rking and knock.\nOn 20 July the armature hd to be removed and e cut taken\non commutator and fan as the assembly was discovered to\nbe slightly out of linc. The motor was out of commission\napproximately ten hours.\n(0) DENSITY LYERS\nGreen-\nwich GCT\nDate Timo Lat.\nLong.\nTop &\nBottom\nof Layer\nChange Pounds\nFlooded\nNone\n140-300\n0\n3000\n-6\nNone\nNone\n215-240 -1 2500\n\u0444\u043e\u0442\nNone\n-10\nNone\nNono\n120-280 -13\n10,000\n140-170 -2\nNone\n140-300\n-1\n1000\n.\n230-300 -5\nNone\n.\n200-300 -8\nNone\n170-260 -3\nNone\nNone\n7/8/44 0700 13-38:58. 115-05.73.\n7/8/44 2146 10-57.3S. 115-36 E.\n7/9/44 0700 09-15 S.\n7/10/44 0131 06-39.2S.\n7/10/44 2203 06-57 S.\n7/11/44 0055 02-20 S.\n7/12/44 2340 01-31 N.\n7/13/44 2200 04-42 N.\n7/14/44 2055 12-43 N.\n115-42 1.\n116-34.2E\n116-22.\n118-27 3.\n119-27.9.\n119-42 E.\n120-42\n117-46 3.\n116-26.8E.\n119-30 E.\n119-41 E.\n120-14.3.\n120-34,\n125-45\n126-21 E\n126-00 E\n126-18.2\n128-10.4\n126-04 3.\n126-25 3.\n200-330 -8\n200-300 -5 None\n200-280 -5 3100\n140-300 -9 None\n7/15/44 0000 12-22.2 N.119-23\n7/16/44 2325 11-42 N.\n7/17/44 1537 12-23.5N.\n7/18/44 2100 13-45 N,\n7/19/44 2055 14-24.9N.\n7/21/44 2258 08-01 N.\n7/22/44 2123 04-21 N.\n7/23/44 2100 02-55 N.\n7/24/44 2238 01-48 s.\n7/25/44 2206 02-48 S.\n7/27/44 0907 06-58 S.\n7/27/44 2324 09-38 S.\n8/1/44 2314 05-50 S.\n8/2/44 1820 01-45 3.\n8/2/44 2146 01-50.5 3.126-34.3 E. 160-250\n8/3/44 2100 02-01 3,\n8/4/44 2140 02-16123\n125-31 E.\n123-42.6E.\n240-300 -2 None\n160-300 -6\n3000\n200-240\n-3\nNone\n200-300\n-3\n2700\n.

COD, from 3 July to 25 August\n1944, was of fifty four days duration of which thirty six days were spent in\nthe area. Aggressiveness and good area coverage were much in evidence during\nthis patrol.\n2.\nTen aggressive torpedo attacks and one gun attack were made on\nenemy shipping. Out of the first load of twenty-four torpedoes only one sure\nhit was made. Undoubtedly poor torpedo performance accounted for some of the\nmisses. Out of the twenty four torpedoes loaded at Darwin eleven hits were\nmade.\nAttack No. 1 A daylight submerged attack on an escorted convoy of\nthree enemy ships after an end around. chase. The first six torpedoes\n(Three at each of two K's) were fired with fairly large gyro angles\nand comparatively long torpedo run. Both targets maneuvered to avoid\nand all torpedoes missed. The four torpedoes fired two minutes later\nat the escort ship were fired with large gyro angles and very small\ntrack angles and all missed.\nAttack No. 2 - Following another end around on the same convoy Cod\nmade a night surface attack with three torpedoes from an excellent\nposition with depth setting three feet. All missed and counteraction\nby the escort prevented further attacks.\nAttack No. 3- A night submerged attack on two large ships with five\nescorts, Six torpedoes were fired with large gyro angles and small\ntrack angles at an escorting destroyer. One hit was heard, possibly\non a trailing.escort.\nAttack No. 4-A night surface attack on a convoy of four AK's and\nfive escorts.
