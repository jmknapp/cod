Upon attempting to fire the\nfourth torpedo (from number 10 tube) the gyro spindle\ndid not retract and tube could not be fired. Investi-\ngation revealed the gyro spindle sleeve (no. 10 tube)\nto be bound in its housing in such a manner that altho\nthe spindle sleeve could, with difficulty, be rotated\nwithin its housing thus allowing gyro angles to be\nset, it was impossible for the sleeve to be moved in\na horizontal direction thereby preventing the retraction\nof the gyro spindle. During the previous evening's\nroutine of this tube, it was noted that the gyro spindle\nengaged and disenged by hand with slightly more stiff-\nness than usual, whereupon the spindle was greased and\noperated repeatedly by hand until sluggishness and stiff-\nness were eliminated. It is believed that this initial\nsluggishness in ope tion was due to the presence of\ndirt or foreign particles between spindle sleeve and\nhousing, and that the repeated operation of the spindle\nsleeve at this time caused small burrs to be formed\non the sleeve or its housing. This condition was\naggravated, during subsequent rotation of the spindle\nsleeve while forcibly matching gyros, to such an ex-\ntent as to prevent the spindle sleeve from moving in\na horizontal plane and retracting the spindle. Exam-\nination of binding grooves and rotary burrs found on\nthe spindle sleevo and its housing appears to verify\nthis explanation. After firing, a discrepancy of 5-7\ndegrees was noted between gyro angles recorded at the\nTDC and those recorded at the gyro setter regulator.\nThis discrepancy can only be accounted for as a per-\nsonnel failure, in that the \"gyro matched\" signal was\ngiven when gyro pointers were not actually matched.\nA cross-check has been incorporated into the routine\nprocedure for matching cyros by hand which will pre-\nvent a reoccurrence of this personnel failure.\n-40-",
  "42": "CONFIDENTIAL\n(L) RADIO\nRadio reception was satisfactory during the\npatrol. Some difficulty was experienced while in the\nvicinity of the Indo-China Coast. Jamming, in the\nform of howlers and keying modulated and unmodulated\nCW, was more or less continuous on Baker schedules,\nbut never serious on Nerk frequencies. All serials\nwere received. Three of the four transmissions were\nreceipted for by VIXØ, the other, transmitted from a\npositi on 30 miles south of Buru Ísland, was receipted\nfor by VHJ at 2040 (H), 1 March, after an unsuccessful\nattempt to deliver it to VIXO. As a matter of interest,\nat 0100 (H), rch while within 60 miles of Darwin,\nwo heard per.. y, a three-way communication via MN\namong Rasher, ton, and Puffer, then operating some\n1200-1400 mil distant, whereas in the South China\nSea, difficulty was experienced establishing communi-\ncation with the Billfish, at a range of 6000 yards.\n(M) RADAR\nThe SD radar exhibited symptons of poor\nperformance, a few days after the start of patrol,\nfunctioned erractically until 18 February when, after\nan aircraft bombing, it quit entirely. At present,\nthe antenna is shorted, probably as a result of shock\nsince no leakage can be located, and will have to be\nrenowed. Prior to complete failure of the antenna\nthe following troubles were located and remedied:\nDouble pulsing and sparking of the transmitter due\nto oxcessive filament voltage on 8014A tubes and\nmisalignment of the transmitter. (Diplexor adjust-\nmont found to be 7 inches from its proper operating\nposition.) Resistor R103 was missing from the pulsing\ncircuit and the bottom ceramic antenna insulator was\ncracked. Antenne reading to ground gradually dropped\nto 1.5 mcgohms with intermittent higher readings when\ndried out over night with a portable blower. During\nlast patrol of this ship, the performance of the SD\nradar was excellent.\nSJ radar operation was fair but unreliable.\nShorted leads, irty contacts, and misalignment of\nthe transmitto caused most difficulties. Condensa-\ntion forming in the antenna tube during a period of\nsilent running rosulted in erractic performance for\nseveral hours after surfacing.\n-41-",
  "43": "CONFIDENTIAL\n(M) RADAR (CONT.)\nRadar interference encountered on the SJ during\nthe night 22-23 February was difficult to distinguish\nfrom that caused by other SJ sets. This interference\noccurred every 20 seconds and the number of pulses on\nthe screen varied from one to several hundred, the pulses\nalways moving from right to left. It seemed possible\nto obtain approximate bearings on this interference,\nand indications that the other radar had interference\nfrom our set was noted when it evidently was shifted\nto hand and the sweep would remain steady for periods\nup to a minute. The gain was reduced so that a pulse\nappeared on precision sweep as shown:\n200\nYDS\nSATURATION\nA plot of the track of this interference indicated wide-\nly varying courses speeds 100-120 knots. The nearest\nU.S. Submarine at this time was distant approximately\n200 miles.\nThe ARC was used during the patrol while SD\nantenna was functioning but gave no indications of the\npresence of enemy radar.\n(N) SOUND GEAR AND SOUND CONDITIONS\nAll sound equipment performed satisfactorily.\nIn shallow water along the China Coast sound\nconditions were fair. In this locality the JP sonic\nequipment was far superior to the supersonic gear,\npropellers being heard at 8000 yards when no results\nwere being obtained with JK-QC equipment.\nNorth of Halmahera Island, sound conditions\nwere exceptional, propeller turn counts being obtained\nwith both sonic and supersonic equipment at 10,000\nyards, and propeller noises tracked to 20,000 yards.\nAlong the cost of Halmahera Island propeller\nturn counts were obtained at 4,000 yards.\nEast of the eastern entrance to Buton Strait,\nsound conditions were good, echo ranging being detected\nat a distance of 14 iles, and turn count obtained at\n10,000 yards.\n-42-",

In some cases the illness\nlasted for 5 days. Shortly before surfacing on 28 Jan-\nuary after an all day dive, various members of the crew\ncomplained of daches, nausea, and dizziness. CO2.\nreading was talon and showed 1.5% CO2. Carbon dioxide\nabsorbent had been in use since submerging. Since this\nwas the first all day dive in several days, it was\nfelt that this might account for the headaches, and\nnausea, but aft inspection, a partially used and im-\nproperly sealed 5 gallon can of carbon tetrachloride\nwas found. Since investigation of the food and water\nconsumed during previous two days caused no suspicion,\nit is presumed that lack of oxygen and the fumes given\noff by the carbon tetrachloride was the reason for\nthese illnesses.

Five contacts worthy\nof torpedoes were made and four of these were attacked, two successfully.\nATTACK was a submerged daylight periscope sighting. A favorable attack\nposition could not be reached so target was trailed and chased on the\nsurface and a night attack was made submerged by periscope in bright moon-\nlight. A spread of four torpedoes was fired and all missed. No torpedo\nexplosions were heard at end of run although the depth of water ranged be-\ntween twenty to twelve fathoms.\n-\nATTACK #2 and #3 were surface radar attacks and both resulted in the\nsinking of an enemy ship.\nATTACK\nmissed due to gyros not being matched.\nThe outbreak of illness as described clearly indicates\nit had its origin in the CC14 fumes saturating the air. Saturation\npoint was in all probability such so as not to bring about more serious\neffects and the rapid recoveries indicate that the degree of poisoning\nwas not sufficient to bring about any serious complications. Steps have\nbeen taken by the COD to prevent the recurrence of this casualty.\n4.\nThe COD returned in excellent material condition and\nwill be refitted in the normal time. It is gratifying to note the favor-\nable comment on page 39, concerning the last refit of the main engines by\nSubmarine Repair Unit, Navy 137, and by #1 Relief Crew of Submarine Divi-\nsion 162.\n5.\nThe Squadron Commander congratulates the Commanding\nOfficer, officers and crew on the completion of their second war patrol,\nand on the damage inflicted upon the enemy.\nAHORA\nH.
