Ran deep at maximum submerged\nspeed to get clear of firing point, and\nsuffered. no damage, probably because of\nshallow depth charge settings. Escorts\napparently formed a line and ran back and forth\nacross the firing point dropping charges as\nrapidly as possible. Depth charging then ceased\nfor 5-6 minutes. Three escorts after a short\nperiod of intermittent echo-ranging, started\ncriss-cross runs, all three escorts apparently\nstarting from the same direction and criss-\ncrossing over our estimated position. Charges\nwere dropped in batches of 2-3 at intervals of\n4-8 minutes, and were set deep. At intervals,\ndepth charging would cease for 5-10 minutes\nwhile escorts echo-ranged. They continued this\nprocedure for about an hour dropping a total of\n40 charges.

In general, VIX heard\nbest thru jamming on 9270 kcs., but static noises on\nthis frequency found to be exceptionally high.\n(M) RADAR\nSD Radar: In general, functioned satisfactorily\nwith reliable plane contacts at 8-10 miles. Slightly reduced\nfilament voltage (from 15 to 14.3 volts) appreciably\ndecreased the failures of 8014A tubes. Washing the\nantenna with soap and fresh water increased the\nantenna insulation resistance from 20,000 ohms to\n30 megohms. This procedure found to be necessary\nevery third or fourth day. Glyptol applied to\nantenna insulator helps maintain higher insulation\nresistance.\nSJ Radar: Performed exceptional ly well\nuntil depth charged; after which range and performance\ndecreased appreciably, as evidenced by poor ranges\nwhen in contact with a convoy. Between time of depth\ncharging and contact with convoy, no contacts were\nmade and opportunity to check tuning and performance\nnot available. Upon retuning and renewal of crystal\ndetector performance again became exceptional. Learned\nthat it is sound routine to check and retune radar\nsoon as possible after depth charging.

For all\nareas patrolled, sound conditions were excellent.\nIn the Manila area echo-ranging was detected at a\nrange of 30,000 yards. At present, a major defect\nexists in the sound gear. At deep submergence\n(200 or more feet), with an up-angle greater than\n2 degrees, rotation of the sound heads causes\na deep, loud rumbling which effectively prevents\nsilent running. While under attack and attempting\nto evade by silent running it was necessary on two\noccassions to discontinue use of the supersonic\nsound gear due to the excessive noise caused by\nrotating the sound heads.\n(0) DENSITY LAYERS\nTypical density layers in operational area\nare tabulated below; no marked change was notice-\nable during any one day:\nDate\nLocation\nLatitude\n4/16 Flores Sea 06-10 S.\nLongitude\n122-12 E.\nLayer Temp Amt.\nLimits Chg.

Comir. H. Pissell, Jr., U3NR.,\nwho, as executive officer and navigator was in-\nstrumental in organizing and training the fire control\nparty, aided in developing the contact and as TDC\noperator, contributed outstandingly to the success\nattained on the submerged attack of May 10th, during\nwhich nine torpedos were fired in approximately 1\nminutes at three different targets and 7 hits\nobtained. During three war patrols this officer\nhas performed his duties in such a competent,\nskillful, and highly successful manner as to bring\ncredit to our naval reserve policy, our Navy and\nhimself. He should be given command of a fleet\ntype submarine at the earliest practicable time.\n-42-",
