The\nfire damaged large portion of tho internal wiring\nof the main control unit, causing the radar to be cut\nof commission for approximately fifteen hours. It is\nbelieved the trouble was caused by a surge in the\nequipment's .C. supply voltage. The operators of\nother radar equipment operating from the samo A.C.\nsupply observed a risc of approximately 30 volts in\nthe A.C. supply voltage at the time of the failure,\nwhich burned out the pilot lights in the APR and SD\nradar.\nIt is suggested that som typo over-voltage cut-\nout system be installed in the .. supply for tho\nradar equipment to prevent further failure of this\ntype.\n(45)",

All small\ncraft hug the coast. In no instance was cargo-filled\nBoat encountered more then 4 miles offshore.\n2. Cargoes:\nIn all except one or two cases, the cargo carried\nwas some form of contraband believed to be essential, de-\nsirable or useful to the Nips. Cargocs were varied,\nrice, sugar and oil boing the main commodities. Also\nfound soap, crude rubber, cffco, paper, horseshoes and\nArmy blankets. It is not too difficult to persuade\none's self that practically all cargo is contraband.\nAt any rate, all large junks or motor sampans were\nconsidered to be potential carriers of ssential goods..\nhere possibl, herts and papers were confiscated.\n3.

COD (SS224) Report of Seventh ar Patrol.\n-\nThe seventh war patrol of the U.S.S. COD under the command of\nLieutenant Commander E.M. ESTBROOK, Jr., U.S. Navy, was conducted in two\nphases; the first off the coast of INDO-CHINA, and the second in the GULF of\nSLAM. The patrol was of 49 days duration with 19 days spent in patrol areas.\nIt was highlighted by 12 successive days of profitable gun actions in the\nGULF of SIAM.\n2.\nOn 9 and 10 July the COD was skillfully maneuvered for 14 hours\nin close proximity to the grounded Dutch Submarine 0-19 in a vain endeavor to\ntow her clear of AD REEF. The crew of the 0-19 was finally transferred to the\nCOD and the 0-19 was completely destroyed by two demolition charges, two torpedo\nhits, and sixteen hits from CCD's 5-inch gun. The high speeds, 34 and 35 knots,\nof the Lk.18 torpedoes for the short runs is noted.\n'3..\nOn 19 July, the COD made an unsuccessful submerged attack on a\nsmall convoy. Convoy had air cover and COD had to run at standard speed sub-\nmerged in smooth sea to close. She was bombed or depth charged just prior to\nfiring. Three torpedoes were fired on sound bearing immediately thereafter.\nNo hits were obtained. The counter attack was not too close. That night,\nafter the unsuccessful attacks on the same convoy by BRILL and BULPER, an end-\naround was made to attain position ahead of the convoy. On commencing approach\nthe radar power supply burned out. Without radar, a submerged daylight attack\nappeared to be the logical choice and CCD proceeded to a position to intercept\nthe convoy after dawn. No further contact was made.\n4.\nDuring the period 21 July1 August, the COD made twenty gun\nattacks on twenty-three junks and motor sampans, plus one towed oil barge,\nsinking them all for a total of 2200 tons. total of sixty-five rounds of\n5-inch and 1092 rounds of 40 1 ammunition were expended during these attacks.\nHer actions in regard to boarding, inspection, and thoughtfulness of the lives\nof native crews symbolize the type action which has made the United States\nrespected the world over.\n-1-\n11 0227",

COD (SS224) Report of Seventh ar Patrol.\n-\n5.\nThe obvious objections to using a submarine as a gunboat were\npractically and thoroughly demonstrated during this aggressive series of ten\nday actions. On 21 July the CCD was twice bombed while in the act of diving.\nOn 1 August she was straffed by a fighter plane and forced to dive, leaving her\nboarding party unassisted on an enemy ship. Fortunately the boarding party was\nrescued by the BLENNY after 48 hours, They were in good health and suffered no\nl effects from their junk cruise. At this stage or she war such tactics are\nessential, despite the obvious objections, if submarines are to continue to do\na heavy share of damage to the enemy.\n6.\nThe practice of firing Mk.14 and 1k.18 torpedoes in the same\nsalvo, as done by the CCD, is not recommended. The inherent advantage of each\ntype torpedo is lost. The wakeless feature of the lk.18 is compromised by the\n2014 in the salvo. The high speed advantage of the Mk.14 is not fully utilized\nwith 30 knot torpedoes fired in the same salvo. An additional load is placed\non the TDC operator at his busiest mcment.\n7.\nSpirit and morale aboard the COD were high when she arrived from\nthis shooting patrol. Material condition is fair with extensive work indicated\non the main engines, hydraulic system, master pro and thrust bearings,\n8.\nThe Squadron Commander welcomes the CD back to this area and\ncongratulates the Commanding Officer, officers and crew on their arduous, ex-\ntended, and successful gunshoot in shallow enemy controlled waters,\nC.
