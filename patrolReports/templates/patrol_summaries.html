        <section id="patrol1">
            <h2>First War Patrol</h2>
            <div class="patrol-dates">October 14 – December 16, 1943 | South China Sea (from Fremantle)</div>
            
            <p>
                USS Cod's maiden war patrol, under Commander J.C. Dempsey, was a 63-day voyage into the South China Sea 
                that established the crew's combat readiness through careful patrolling and their first successful attack.
            </p>
            
            <h3>First Contact: Arrival at a Torpedoed Tanker</h3>
            <p>
                On <strong>November 8, 1943</strong>, at 0405, Cod heard a series of 12 explosions ahead while patrolling 
                near Macclesfield Bank. When they closed to investigate, they found a <strong>burning tanker</strong> 
                already torpedoed by another submarine, blazing so intensely that details were indiscernible. 
                A Chidori-class escort was circling, echo-ranging. The tanker exploded violently at 0653 and sank—Cod 
                had witnessed another sub's handiwork.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The First Attack: Convoy in Palawan Passage (November 29)</h3>
            <p>
                Cod's first true attack came on <strong>November 29</strong> at dawn in the Palawan Passage. In poor 
                visibility with rain squalls, the crew sighted a convoy of 4 ships (1 tanker, 2 freighters, 1 transport) 
                escorted by a Minekaze-class destroyer.
            </p>
            <p>
                At 0621, Commander Dempsey fired 6 torpedoes at the AK (cargo ship) and AP (transport):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Two hits</strong> observed on the AK between the stack and after mast; the ship began listing and settling</li>
                <li><strong>One hit</strong> on the AP abaft the stack</li>
                <li>One torpedo suffered a <strong>premature explosion</strong>, which alerted a nearby aircraft that bombed the periscope's wake</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The escort dropped depth charges (none closer than 400 yards). Sound reported the distinct crackling 
                and groaning of a <strong>ship breaking up</strong>. The AK was later assessed as sunk.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Returning with Engine Troubles</h3>
            <p>
                The patrol was cut short due to deteriorating main engine exhaust valves. Cod returned to Fremantle 
                on December 16, 1943, having established herself as a combat-ready boat with a confirmed sinking.
            </p>

        <!-- PATROL 2 -->
        <section id="patrol2">
            <h2>Second War Patrol</h2>
            <div class="patrol-dates">January 11 – March 13, 1944 | South China Sea & Indo-China Coast</div>
            
            <p>
                Departing <strong>Fremantle on January 11, 1944</strong>, Cod's second patrol was marked by 
                frustration, illness, and a maddeningly elusive convoy that the crew chased for days without 
                firing a shot.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Mass Illness: Carbon Tetrachloride Poisoning (January 28)</h3>
            <div class="highlight danger">
                On <strong>January 28</strong>, after an all-day submerged dive off the Indo-China coast, crew members 
                began complaining of headaches, nausea, and dizziness. Initially, the symptoms were attributed to 
                elevated CO₂ levels (measured at 1.5%). But after surfacing, a search revealed the true culprit: 
                a <strong>partially used and improperly sealed 5-gallon can of carbon tetrachloride</strong>—a 
                common cleaning solvent whose fumes are highly toxic in enclosed spaces.
            </div>
            <p>
                Upon surfacing, half the crew was already nauseated and many started vomiting. Within an hour, 
                <strong>practically the entire crew</strong> exhibited symptoms: cramps, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, 
                weak pulse, and subnormal temperature. About half recovered during the night's surface operations; 
                the rest took two more days. Some cases lasted as long as <strong>five days</strong>. The debilitated 
                crew would soon face a convoy they couldn't catch.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Convoy Chase That Got Away (January 29–30)</h3>
            <p>
                On <strong>January 29</strong>, Cod sighted a northbound convoy—1 tanker, 2 freighters, and 2-3 escorts—close 
                to the Indo-China coast. The crew began a grueling <strong>all-night surface chase</strong>, attempting to 
                get ahead for a night attack.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite multiple approach attempts, everything went wrong: visual bearings didn't match the TDC setup, 
                enemy zigs placed them too close or too far from track, and the nearly-incapacitated crew struggled to perform.
            </p>
            <p>
                Commander Dempsey wrote in his report that the officers and crew "performed their duties to the best 
                of their abilities" but accepted "full responsibility for this fiasco." The convoy escaped toward 
                Tourane Bay at dawn, never to be seen again.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Gun Action: The Rising Sun Sampan (February 16)</h3>
            <p>
                In a rare surface engagement, Cod encountered a <strong>power-driven sampan</strong> with the Rising Sun 
                painted on its deck house, 160 miles from land. When the sampan either opened fire with small arms or 
                began signaling, Cod's gun crews <strong>set it ablaze and blew it apart</strong> with 4-inch and 20mm fire.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Successful Night Attack: The Zuiyo Maru (February 23)</h3>
            <p>
                After weeks of frustration, Cod finally scored on <strong>February 23</strong> northeast of Morotai Island. 
                At 0524, lookouts sighted smoke and a mast—a large <strong>Zuiyo Maru-type tanker</strong> (~7,360 tons) 
                escorted by a smaller maru and a subchaser echo-ranging on 17 KCS. Cod tracked submerged through 
                daylight, surfaced at 1120, and chased until nightfall.
            </p>
            <p>
                At 2218, Cod closed to 2,300 yards and fired a spread of four torpedoes at the tanker:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>first torpedo swerved 20-30° left</strong> and prematured after 25 seconds</li>
                <li>The <strong>second hit under the mainmast</strong> with a flash that "lighted the horizon"</li>
                <li>The <strong>third hit under the stack</strong> with an even greater flash—the ship broke in half</li>
                <li>All parts burst into flames; the ship <strong>disappeared in two minutes</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <div class="highlight success">
                From the character of the explosions and the rapidity with which the ship blew up, Commander Dempsey 
                concluded the cargo must have been <strong>gasoline or fuel oil</strong>. Two additional torpedoes 
                fired at the escort maru missed—the depths were set for a larger ship.
            </div>
            
            <h3>Attack Under Fire (February 27)</h3>
            <p>
                Four days later, off <strong>South Loloda Island</strong> near Halmahera, Cod made radar contact 
                at 12,000 yards on a large freighter hugging the coast with a small escort trailing 700-1,000 yards 
                astern. The target appeared to be an MFM-type freighter of about <strong>5,000-6,000 tons</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                At 0257, Cod closed to attack. But at 0258, with range 3,200 yards, the target began 
                <strong>signaling to its escort</strong>—and both ships <strong>opened fire</strong> on the submarine. 
                No splashes were seen, but Cod was now attacking under enemy gunfire.
            </p>
            <p>
                Undeterred, at 0259 Commander Dempsey fired a spread of four torpedoes at 2,900 yards:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>first hit the stern</strong> with a violent explosion—a large portion appeared blown into the air</li>
                <li>A large fire immediately broke out with much smoke</li>
                <li>The <strong>second hit amidships</strong></li>
                <li>Two minutes later, a second more violent explosion; flames died out and the target <strong>disappeared</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The radar pip vanished at 4,500 yards. The escort fired guns and dropped depth charges for 
                20 minutes after the attack, but Cod slipped away.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The One That Got Away: 100 Lookouts (February 29)</h3>
            <p>
                Two days later, near <strong>Buton Strait</strong>, Cod detected echo-ranging at an estimated 
                24,000 yards—an hour before actually sighting the target. It proved to be a <strong>Yamazato 
                Maru-type cargo ship</strong> escorted by a <strong>Terutsuki-class destroyer</strong>, one of 
                Japan's most capable anti-submarine vessels.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Cod maneuvered for a stern tube shot, the crew observed an unusual sight: <strong>at least 
                100 Japanese sailors lining the destroyer's rails</strong>, apparently serving as periscope 
                lookouts. The Japanese were learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                At 1449, Cod fired three torpedoes—but the gyro regulator had tripped out a minute before firing, 
                forcing the crew to match gyros by hand. A fourth torpedo couldn't fire at all; its gyro spindle 
                was frozen. Post-attack analysis revealed the gyro angles lagged 5-7 degrees behind the TDC 
                settings, causing all torpedoes to miss astern. The Terutsuki dropped depth charges—close ones—but 
                Cod escaped to fight another day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cod returned to <strong>Fremantle on March 13, 1944</strong>. With two confirmed sinkings 
                despite the frustrations, Patrol 2 was deemed <strong>successful</strong>.

        <section id="patrol3">
            <h2>Third War Patrol</h2>
            <div class="patrol-dates">April 6 – June 1, 1944 | Sulu Sea & West Coast of Luzon</div>
            
            <p>
                Departing <strong>Fremantle on April 6, 1944</strong>, Cod's third patrol took her through the 
                Celebes Sea and into the Sulu Sea, operating off the Zamboanga Peninsula and the dangerous 
                shallows near Basilan Strait.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Training with USS Jack</h3>
            <p>
                The patrol began with valuable mutual training exercises in company with <strong>USS Jack</strong> 
                along the approach to Darwin. The submarines practiced surface and submerged approaches against 
                each other, giving lookouts numerous opportunities to observe periscopes at varying ranges—training 
                that would prove invaluable.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Hunting in the Makassar Strait (April 16-20)</h3>
            <p>
                Cod spent nearly a week patrolling the Makassar Strait, encountering heavy sailboat traffic but 
                frustratingly little enemy shipping. On <strong>April 19</strong>, they tracked what appeared to be 
                a target with echo-ranging and smoke, but the ship remained tantalizingly out of sight. During the 
                pursuit, Cod ran into an <strong>extensive area of submerged wreckage</strong> including parts of a 
                ship, huge logs, and debris—bending the pit-log swordarm and giving the torpedo shutters a severe banging.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The High-Speed Target (April 25)</h3>
            <p>
                On <strong>April 25</strong>, Cod made radar contact on a target making <strong>15-16 knots</strong>—a 
                medium-sized, high-speed vessel detected at an unusual 18,000 yards. Despite a night-long chase 
                approaching Basilan Strait, the target made a landfall on Teinga Island and altered course to the 
                southwest, escaping into waters too shallow for pursuit.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The "Forest of Masts": Attack on 33-Ship Convoy (May 10)</h3>
            <p>
                The patrol's defining moment came on <strong>May 10</strong> off Luzon. At 0159, in bright moonlight, 
                lookouts sighted smoke on the horizon. As Cod closed, radar revealed contact after contact—a massive 
                convoy. Commander Dempsey wrote: <em>"The area to the northeast looked like a forest."</em> He counted 
                masts and smoke from <strong>33 ships</strong>, not including more visible only as distant smoke.
            </p>
            <p>
                The convoy was organized into four formations, each with 2-3 columns. Kamikaze-class destroyers patrolled 
                ahead and on the flanks; Chidori torpedo boats and minesweepers wove through the interior. Two Mavis 
                flying boats provided air cover.
            </p>
            <div class="highlight success">
                At 0555, Cod struck. First, three stern tube torpedoes at a <strong>Kamikaze-class destroyer</strong> 
                at just 650 yards. The first hit right under the bridge—<em>"Both stacks collapsed, and dozens of the 
                crew (in white uniforms) who had been lining the rails acting as periscope lookouts were tossed into 
                the air."</em> The ship sagged in the middle as a second torpedo disintegrated her fantail.
            </div>
            <p>
                Swinging immediately to the bow tubes, Dempsey fired six more torpedoes at the cargo ships in 
                <strong>84 seconds</strong>—two at a Kasado Maru-type transport, four at a large Asosan Maru-type freighter. 
                The overlapping targets meant even misses might find a hull. Sound tracked the torpedoes running true: 
                one hit on the Kasado Maru, three hits on the Asosan Maru, and one more on a Brisbane Maru-type in the 
                far column after a run of 3,800 yards.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Nine torpedoes fired in under two minutes. Seven hits.</strong> Breaking-up noises filled 
                the sound gear. For the next two hours, the crew heard the distinctive "firecracker explosions" of 
                ammunition cargo detonating.
            </p>
            <div class="highlight danger">
                The escorts responded with fury. Four ships arrived and dropped <strong>70 depth charges in 15 minutes</strong>, 
                saturation-bombing the firing point. Aircraft added bombs of their own. The counter-attack continued 
                for two hours. Cod ran deep and silent, maneuvering to keep the escorts astern. She finally surfaced 
                <strong>12 hours after firing</strong>, in a thunderstorm, 20 miles from the attack position—only to 
                encounter a Chidori torpedo boat still searching the area.
            </div>
            <p>
                The patrol report credited Cod with sinking one destroyer (1,315 tons) and probably sinking three 
                cargo ships totaling over 20,000 tons.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Eerie Transit of Sibutu Passage</h3>
            <p>
                On the return voyage, Cod experienced an unsettling night transit of <strong>Sibutu Passage</strong>. 
                Between 0100 and 0400 on May 23—with the moon nearly full—and reports that the passage was 
                "heavily patrolled," the crew picked up approximately <strong>30 radar contacts</strong> on small 
                objects at ranges from 2,000 down to 800 yards. Some passed as close as 400-500 yards. Yet even 
                in the bright moonlight, <strong>none could be sighted</strong>. The radar pips resembled those 
                from oil drums or fishstakes, but their true nature remained a mystery as Cod crept southward 
                3-4 miles off Sibutu Island's east coast.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Return to Fremantle</h3>
            <p>
                The patrol concluded with transits through Makassar Strait and Lombok Strait. Cod returned to 
                <strong>Fremantle on June 1, 1944</strong>. The May 10 attack made this one of Cod's most successful 
                patrols—one destroyer confirmed sunk and three large cargo ships probably sunk, totaling over 
                21,000 tons.

        <section id="patrol4">
            <h2>Fourth War Patrol</h2>
            <div class="patrol-dates">July 3 – August 25, 1944 | Sulu Sea, Celebes Sea & Makassar Strait</div>
            
            <p>
                Cod's fourth patrol, now under Commander J.A. Adkins, was plagued by <strong>torpedo failures</strong> 
                that proved maddeningly persistent. With each failed attack, the report noted, "the Commanding Officer 
                had become more and more anxious to destroy these... targets." Despite multiple well-executed attacks, 
                the torpedoes consistently ran deep or failed to detonate.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Fueling at the Muiron Islands (July 6)</h3>
            <p>
                Before heading into the patrol area, Cod topped off her fuel tanks at the <strong>Muiron Islands</strong>, 
                a staging anchorage off Western Australia near Exmouth Gulf. On <strong>July 6</strong>, she came alongside 
                USS <strong>Sandlance</strong> and received <strong>12,000 gallons of diesel oil</strong>—submarines 
                supporting each other in the field. Sandlance then proceeded to the fuel barge in Exmouth Gulf to 
                replenish what she'd shared.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Wolf Pack Operations with Cabrilla</h3>
            <p>
                This patrol marked Cod's first <strong>coordinated operations</strong> with other submarines. 
                She operated in conjunction with USS Cabrilla and later USS Bluefish, exchanging information and 
                coordinating search patterns via SJ radar and hand-keying signals.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Attack 1: The Torpedoes That Ran Deep (July 16)</h3>
            <p>
                On <strong>July 16</strong>, Cod attacked three MFM-type steamers of about 2,000 tons each 
                in the Sulu Sea near Busuanga. Despite a textbook approach:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fired 3 torpedoes at Ship A and 3 at Ship B with depths set at 6 feet</li>
                <li>Fired 4 stern tubes at Ship A as it turned</li>
                <li><strong>No hits</strong></li>
                <li>Received <strong>14 depth charges</strong> in return, causing minor damage</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Attack 2: The TDC Says It Should Have Worked (July 17)</h3>
            <div class="highlight danger">
                That night, Cod regained contact and executed what the CO described as "a very careful attack":
                night surface radar approach, tracked targets for 2 hours, set torpedo depths at <strong>3 feet</strong>, 
                fired 3 torpedoes at 1,500 yards. <strong>The CO watched two torpedo wakes pass directly under 
                the target.</strong> All three missed. Two were later noted as running deep.
            </div>
            <p>
                After surfacing, the crew performed something remarkable: they <strong>replayed the attack on the 
                TDC</strong>. The Mark IV Torpedo Data Computer could rerun a firing problem using the recorded 
                inputs, allowing post-attack analysis. The replay revealed two issues: "firing was commenced too 
                soon" and "ship's head was swinging during firing"—the boat was still turning when the torpedoes 
                left the tubes. But critically, the TDC rerun showed that <strong>at least one torpedo should 
                have hit</strong>. The geometry was correct; the torpedoes simply ran too deep.
            </p>
            <p>
                This kind of rigorous analysis—using the TDC's replay capability to distinguish between crew 
                error and torpedo failure—was standard practice. In this case, it confirmed what the CO suspected: 
                the MK 23 torpedoes were running deeper than set. The escort chased and fired at Cod, with shells 
                splashing close aboard before they escaped.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Attack in the Storm (July 19-20)</h3>
            <p>
                On <strong>July 19</strong>, heavy swells and whitecaps from the southwest made depth control 
                difficult. At periscope depth near Cabra Island, Cod had to <strong>"use negative" twice</strong>—rapidly 
                flooding the negative buoyancy tank to pull the boat down when waves pushed her toward the surface. 
                These were challenging conditions for a submerged approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                The weather worsened. On <strong>July 20</strong>, Cod contacted another convoy at 21,000 yards 
                and tracked it by radar alone—visibility was less than 1,000 yards due to heavy rain and dark, 
                overhanging clouds. The target, a 4,000-5,000 ton AK, was visible only in <strong>brief lightning 
                flashes</strong>. At 0444, Cod fired four stern tubes at 1,350 yards. The TDC solution was good; 
                post-attack analysis confirmed the firing data was correct.
            </p>
            <div class="highlight info">
                No hits were observed. The patrol report's conclusion was blunt: <em>"It is felt that hits should 
                and would have been obtained if sea conditions were not too bad for proper performance."</em> 
                Heavy seas could affect torpedo depth-keeping, and the violent motion of the submarine during 
                firing could throw off even a perfect TDC solution. Upon surfacing: "Very heavy seas."
            </div>
            
            <h3>Refit at Darwin (July 29-30)</h3>
            <p>
                After the frustrating series of attacks with no confirmed hits, Cod put into <strong>Darwin on 
                July 29</strong> for torpedo reloads and repairs. She departed the following day, heading for 
                the Celebes Sea—where her luck would finally change.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Success in the Celebes Sea (August 3)</h3>
            <div class="highlight success">
                Operating with Bluefish near Lifumatola Island, Cod finally scored. Tracking a medium AK 
                with escort in bright moonlight, the target spotted Cod on her unprotected port quarter 
                at 3,500 yards—and <strong>attempted to ram</strong>. It was, as the CO noted, "a poor tactic." 
                Cod fired 4 stern tubes at close range—<strong>3 hits</strong> completely enveloped the target 
                in black smoke. Breaking-up noises confirmed the kill. The escort dropped only 4 depth charges 
                before leaving the area.
            </div>
            
            <h3>More Sinkings in the Gulf of Boni (August 10-14)</h3>
            <p>
                Cod continued her successful streak in the Celebes area:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>August 10:</strong> Sank a small AK with 3 torpedo hits. While examining the wreckage—oil slick, debris, empty depth charge casings—a head was noted "popping up from a large floating box." The survivor was glad to be rescued and was made prisoner.</li>
                <li><strong>August 10-11:</strong> Attacked an unidentified 4,000-ton vessel, hitting with 4 torpedoes in two attacks. Target sank by stern.</li>
                <li><strong>August 13-14:</strong> Chased and sank a high-speed landing barge after a surface gun battle and torpedo attack—3 torpedo hits caused spectacular ammunition explosions.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Return to Fremantle</h3>
            <p>
                On August 19, Cod entered Ombai Passage for the homeward transit, paralleling the coast of Alor 
                at 6-7 miles. That night, the crew observed <strong>brush fires on Timor</strong>—and on the 
                southern tip of Pantar Island, a <strong>"large fire or volcano"</strong> glowing in the darkness. 
                The report noted an "active volcano presumed be DLAKI DLANA on PANTAR ISLAND... observed from 35 
                miles distant." In reality, there is no volcano at Pantar's southern tip; the crew was likely 
                seeing the incandescence of <strong>Pura</strong>, a small but active volcanic island just south 
                of Pantar, its glow visible across the dark tropical waters.

                Cod returned to <strong>Fremantle on August 25, 1944</strong>. Despite the early torpedo 
                frustrations, the patrol ended successfully with multiple confirmed sinkings in the 
                Celebes Sea region.

        <section id="patrol5">
            <h2>Fifth War Patrol</h2>
            <div class="patrol-dates">September 18 – November 20, 1944 | West of Luzon & Palawan Passage</div>
            
            <p>
                Departing <strong>Fremantle on September 18, 1944</strong>, Cod's fifth patrol was her most 
                productive, featuring multiple attacks, coordinated wolf pack operations with USS Ray, and the 
                sinking of significant enemy tonnage. This patrol would also mark her transfer from the 
                Australia-based submarine force to the Pacific Fleet.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Stopover at Darwin (September 25-27)</h3>
            <p>
                En route to her patrol area, Cod entered Darwin harbor on <strong>September 25</strong> and 
                moored alongside USS Coucal, a submarine tender. The crew commenced <strong>loading torpedoes, 
                fueling, and making voyage repairs</strong>. Cod's CO met with the commanding officer of 
                USS Angler to exchange tactical intelligence, and obtained information on allied merchant 
                shipping from a <strong>Royal Australian Intelligence officer</strong> at Darwin. Most 
                significantly, Cod received new orders by despatch: she was to conduct <strong>coordinated 
                search and attack operations with USS Ray</strong> in areas west of southern Luzon and Palawan—
                the beginning of her wolf pack assignment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The departure on <strong>September 26</strong> did not go smoothly. Shortly after getting 
                underway, the <strong>bow planes failed to rig in</strong> during testing, followed by a 
                <strong>fire in the rigging panel</strong>. The crew cleared electrical circuits but could 
                not reduce the heavy overload. At 1244, Cod reversed course for Darwin. Coucal, having 
                decoded Cod's message, got underway immediately to escort her back into harbor. Repairs 
                were completed, and Cod finally departed on <strong>September 27</strong>.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Coordinated Pack Operations with Ray</h3>
            <p>
                Operating under these new orders, Cod worked as part of a two-boat wolf pack with USS Ray, 
                coordinating via SJ radar communications and voice radio. The boats exchanged tactical 
                information and divided patrol areas to maximize coverage of the approaches to Manila.
            </p>
            <div class="highlight info">
                <strong>The Wolf Pack Communications Problem:</strong> Commander Adkins used his patrol report 
                to lodge a pointed critique. Submarines were using the SJ radar for inter-boat communication 
                by "hand-keying"—but while transmitting, <em>"it can not be used for tracking."</em> He warned: 
                <em>"Sooner or later a boat will be sunk by an enemy that he would have destroyed or avoided 
                had he been searching at the time with his SJ."</em> His solution: reinstall the TBS 
                (Talk Between Ships) voice radio. <em>"Why was it removed?"</em> he asked pointedly. 
                It was the kind of real-world feedback that shaped submarine doctrine through the war.
            </div>
            
            <h3>Lifeguard Search for B-24 Crew (October 1)</h3>
            <p>
                On <strong>October 1</strong>, Cod joined USS Angler in searching for 9 crew members from a downed 
                B-24 bomber in the Makassar Strait. They questioned native schooners and conducted a parallelogram 
                search pattern. Despite extensive efforts, the aviators were never found.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Tanker That Wouldn't Die (October 5-6)</h3>
            <p>
                The signature attack began when Cod sighted a 5-ship convoy off Mindoro protected by a 
                Wakatake-class destroyer. In terrible visibility with rain squalls:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Attack 1 (1318):</strong> Fired 4 bow tubes at a large tanker and 2 at an AK. 
                    Two hits on the tanker with "great balls of fire billowing up"</li>
                <li>The Wakatake dropped 32 depth charges—one harrowing hour of evasion. At one point, the 
                    familiar deep booms changed to "smaller, more frequent explosions with a sharp crack." 
                    The control party said in unison: <strong>"Mousetraps"</strong>—recognizing the distinctive 
                    sound of forward-throwing anti-submarine rockets</li>
                <li><strong>Attack 2 (1517):</strong> The tanker was still afloat but crippled. Fired 4 more 
                    torpedoes—<strong>4 hits</strong>. The tanker "disappeared almost immediately leaving a 
                    low, thin patch of steam along his length."</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="highlight success">
                <strong>Total confirmed:</strong> 1 large tanker (EU) 10,000 tons SUNK
            </div>
            
            <h3>Running with Ray Against Convoys (October 6-7)</h3>
            <p>
                After the tanker attack, Cod formed a scouting line with USS Ray. They tracked a large 15,000-ton 
                oiler with escorts. Cod's stern tube attack scored <strong>2 hits</strong>, and Ray finished the 
                damaged oiler the following morning.
            </p>
            <div class="highlight danger">
                What followed was, in the CO's words, <em>"the most harrowing hour of my experience."</em> Two escorts 
                hunted Cod relentlessly—pinging, listening, making run after run directly overhead. The CO wrote: 
                <em>"It is impossible to describe the tension attached to listening for the charges when you know 
                that the scoundrel is in a good dropping position and he does not drop."</em> They dropped only 
                8 charges total, but the silent stalking was far worse than depth charging.
            </div>
            
            <h3>Attacking a Warship (October 8)</h3>
            <p>
                Cod encountered a 1,500-ton warship with unusual "ski-slide" stern configuration. After maneuvering 
                for position, Cod fired 6 bow tubes—but the target spotted the torpedo wakes and turned to avoid. 
                The escort dropped 5 depth charges and departed.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Green Water Down the Hatch (October 9)</h3>
            <p>
                The following morning brought the patrol's only heavy weather. During a radar approach on 
                two small escort vessels, Cod attempted to force through heavy seas on the surface. The result: 
                <strong>"a large amount of water down the conning tower hatch."</strong> No material damage, 
                but a reminder that the sea itself could be as dangerous as the enemy.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Lifeguard Duty for Carrier Strikes (October 16-18)</h3>
            <p>
                Cod was assigned lifeguard duty west of Subic Bay during carrier strikes on Luzon. These raids 
                were part of the opening phase of the <strong>U.S. reconquest of the Philippines</strong>, conducted 
                by <strong>U.S. Navy Task Force 38</strong> under <strong>Admiral William F. Halsey</strong>—just 
                two days before the amphibious landings at Leyte on <strong>October 20, 1944</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                On <strong>October 18</strong>, with her BK beacon lit, searchlight rigged, flares mounted, 
                and colors flying, Cod watched flights of 30 aircraft—SB2Cs and F6Fs—approach from the south, 
                heading northeast for Subic. Two fighters peeled off to investigate Cod; she turned to show 
                her silhouette, and they passed six miles away.
            </p>
            <p>
                Commander Adkins was so moved by the sight that he quoted <strong>Tennyson's "Locksley Hall"</strong> 
                in his patrol report—an 1835 poem that prophetically imagined aerial warfare:
            </p>
            <blockquote style="font-style:italic; border-left:3px solid var(--brass); padding-left:15px; margin:15px 0; color:#ccc;">
                "Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rain'd a ghostly dew<br>
                From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue..."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                He added wryly: <em>"It all seemed to fit, except the final line. If we want to reserve 
                MANILA and SUBIC BAYS for our own use in the next war, we had better keep plenty of airy 
                navy stationed there."</em>
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Gun Attack "Fiasco" (October 22)</h3>
            <p>
                Off Cape Bolinao, Cod sighted five <strong>"sea trucks"</strong>—motor-driven boats with 
                foresails—heading south. The OOD talked the CO into a battle surface to engage with the 
                4-inch deck gun. What followed was, in Commander Adkins' words, a <em>"fiasco."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The third shot scored a hit—but had no effect. Then the <strong>foot-firing mechanism jammed</strong>. 
                While the crew cleared the jam, all five sea trucks turned toward Cod and opened fire with 
                .30 to .50 caliber guns. Their shots fell 1,000 yards short, but <em>"the ricochets were 
                singing all around us."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Cod turned away, cleared the jam, and resumed firing—<strong>75 rounds total</strong>. The 
                deflection control was "beautiful," but the pointing was "exasperating": shots fell 100 yards 
                over, then 50 short, then 50 over, with "monotonous regularity." One more hit was scored, 
                again with no effect. Approaching the 100-fathom curve near shore, Cod broke off.
            </p>
            <p>
                When another sea truck was spotted, the CO called the gun crew back to stations <em>"to let 
                them save their face"</em>—but an aircraft contact forced them to clear the deck and submerge, 
                losing the breech cover in the process. Adkins reflected that more would have been sunk had 
                he <em>"dashed in to close range with 20 mms, machine guns, and 4-inch all blazing."</em>
            </p>
            
            <h3>The ASAMA MARU Convoy (October 24–26)</h3>
            <p>
                On the evening of <strong>October 24</strong>, Cod made radar contact with a major convoy: 
                the transport <strong>ASAMA MARU</strong>—a 16,975-ton ocean liner converted to troop 
                transport—accompanied by three large cargo ships and five escorts. This was exactly the 
                kind of high-value target submarines hunted. Cod had just <strong>four torpedoes 
                remaining</strong>, all in her stern tubes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The targets tracked at 15 knots, zigging every five minutes. As Cod worked up ahead, 
                ASAMA MARU began making 60-degree zigs, pulling away from the other ships. Commander 
                Adkins picked the transport as his target and closed for a stern shot. At <strong>0402 
                on October 25</strong>, Cod fired her last four torpedoes at 4,300 yards range.
            </p>
            <p>
                All four missed. No splashes, no explosions—nothing. The fire control had checked 
                perfectly; no fault could be found. The CO's anguish was palpable:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "No one could feel more deeply about missing this target than myself and crew. The 
                thought of the American and Australian soldiers that may be killed by the enemy troops 
                and equipment in this transport is very sobering, indeed."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                In his later analysis, he reflected:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "The saddest feature of the whole attack, to me, is that under similar circumstances 
                I would not know how to conduct it differently. With a high speed target, on a clear 
                night, zigging widely on short legs, and torpedoes aft only, I know of no better means 
                of approach than to get up ahead, wait for a favorable zig and take the best shot that 
                presents itself, within the maximum range of the torpedo."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Now truly <strong>out of torpedoes</strong>, Cod could have broken off. Instead, 
                at 0436, Commander Adkins made a fateful decision:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "After missing this cold set-up, I determined then and there that we would track this 
                convoy until we should turn it over to another submarine."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                For the next <strong>30 hours</strong>, Cod shadowed the convoy, sending contact 
                reports with position, course, and speed to anyone who could attack. The reports 
                went out to <em>"all hands from Admiral HALSEY down"</em>—including the China Air 
                Force, in case the convoy was headed for Indo-China. On the area frequency, she 
                broadcast with the added information that she was <em>"trailing, with no torpedoes."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Multiple submarines received Cod's broadcasts. USS <strong>Cero</strong>, patrolling nearby, 
                intercepted the contact reports and headed north to intercept. But Cero was on a 
                <strong>Special Mission</strong>—a covert supply run, delivering 17 tons of supplies and 
                16 U.S. Army personnel to Philippine guerrillas along the coast of Luzon. Her orders 
                explicitly <em>"prohibited attacking an escorted merchant convoy"</em>: an attack could 
                draw Japanese forces to the area and compromise the rendezvous. Cero could only engage 
                <em>"important warships"</em>—everything else had to be avoided.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cero tried to tell Cod she would go around astern to trail and report, but couldn't raise 
                her: <em>"Unable to raise COD by radio or SJ."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The convoy escaped. At 2229, it rounded Cape Fief off San Fernando, slowed, and 
                <strong>entered Lingayen Gulf</strong>. Cod patrolled north of Cape Bolinao, waiting 
                for them to come out—but they never did. Cero later concluded: <em>"Apparently the convoy 
                reported by COD anchored overnight in one of the several refuges along the west coast of 
                Luzon."</em> Cero couldn't pass this intelligence to Cod—transmitting via shore station 
                <em>"would subject us to DF'ing"</em> (direction-finding by the enemy).
            </p>
            <div class="highlight info">
                <strong>What ASAMA MARU was carrying:</strong> The convoy was transporting elements of 
                the Imperial Japanese Army's <strong>1st Division</strong> from China to the Philippines. 
                Despite constant attacks by American submarines and aircraft, over 12,000 troops were 
                successfully delivered to reinforce Luzon prior to the American landings—troops that 
                would soon be killing American and Australian soldiers, just as Commander Adkins feared.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Her eventual fate:</strong> On her return voyage from Manila to Takao, ASAMA MARU 
                embarked 1,383 military and civilian personnel. On <strong>November 1, 1944</strong>—just 
                one week after escaping Cod—she was torpedoed by USS <strong>Atule</strong> in the Bashi 
                Channel and sank in less than ten minutes. Of her passengers and crew, 1,131 were rescued.
            </div>
            
            <h3>Tracking for Bream (October 27)</h3>
            <p>
                The next evening, <strong>October 27</strong>, Cod picked up another target: a lone, unescorted 
                merchantman—a large cargo ship of about 7,500 tons—heading south along the coast. Still out 
                of torpedoes, Cod again became a <strong>tracker</strong>. She called USS Bream on voice radio, 
                reporting: <em>"trailing lone merchantman, course 145."</em> Bream replied: <em>"save this 
                plum for us."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                For the next several hours, Cod shadowed the target, broadcasting contact reports with 
                <strong>position, course, speeds, zig plan, base course</strong>—everything Bream needed to 
                close in. Bream's patrol report later praised Cod's coordination: <em>"COD kept up running 
                commentary on target's course and speed. His work in trailing could not have been better, 
                and we much appreciated this opportunity."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The attack, however, did not go as planned. As Bream closed to 11,500 yards, the target 
                spotted her—silhouetted by the near-full moon—and <strong>opened fire with gunfire</strong>. 
                The merchantman turned and ran, zigging violently. Despite the chase, Bream eventually 
                broke off at 0443.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bream's CO was crushed: <em>"This is certainly a heart breaker. COD will be plenty burned 
                up and rightly Target was large AK."</em> On surfacing, they discovered the real culprit—the 
                <strong>radar shafting had been knocked out of alignment</strong>, causing discrepancies between 
                sound and radar bearings that hampered the approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                The moonlight explanation came two days later. After departing the prisoner rendezvous with Cod, 
                Bream's CO noticed they could see Cod <em>"out to range over 10,000 yards in moonlight—After 
                Radar had lost pip."</em> His conclusion: <em>"Guess the target saw us last night."</em> The 
                "plum" escaped not through supernatural luck, but because submarines were visible at tremendous 
                range in bright moonlight—and the merchantman had been watching.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Transfer to Pearl Harbor</h3>
            <p>
                On <strong>October 29</strong>, Bream rendezvoused with Cod to transfer prisoners. Bream's 
                log records the exchange of recognition signals at 0323, then at 0440: <em>"Transferred six 
                prisoners to COD. Wished all hands luck on way home. Felt tough all over again about missing 
                out on last nights target. COD was not too crazy about the Japs."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The prisoners were Japanese soldiers whose transport had been sunk from under them. Their 
                condition was grim: the men were <em>"covered with open ulcerated sores similar to the sores 
                of syphilis, and chancres."</em> The pharmacist's mate treated them with sulfa powder and 
                ointment dressings.
            </p>
            <p>
                The prisoners were kept strictly isolated from the crew. The <strong>magazine was converted 
                to a brig</strong>, and after the prisoners departed at Saipan, the space was scrubbed with 
                soap and water, then <strong>wiped down with torpedo alcohol</strong>—the Navy's all-purpose 
                disinfectant.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cod stopped briefly at <strong>Saipan on November 6</strong>—where she experienced two night 
                air raids by Japanese aircraft—before continuing east. She arrived at <strong>Pearl Harbor 
                on November 20, 1944</strong>, completing her transfer from the Southwest Pacific submarine 
                force to the Pacific Fleet.

            <h2>Sixth War Patrol</h2>
            <div class="patrol-dates">March 24 – May 29, 1945 | East China Sea & Formosa Strait (Pearl Harbor via Guam)</div>
            
            <p>
                Cod departed <strong>Pearl Harbor on March 24, 1945</strong> and arrived at <strong>Guam 
                on April 9</strong>. There she received orders under <strong>ComSubPac Operation Order 
                No. 75-45</strong> to conduct coordinated patrol and lifeguard operations for the 5th Air 
                Force with <strong>USS Pompon</strong> in the East China Sea. Getting underway that same day, 
                Commander J.A. Adkins led Cod on this harrowing 51-day mission into the heavily mined and 
                defended waters of the East China Sea and Formosa Strait. The patrol featured close-quarters 
                gun battles, torpedo attacks, and narrow escapes.
            </p>
            
            <h3>A Harrowing Day (April 14)</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>April 14</strong> proved to be one of the patrol's most harrowing days. That morning, 
                a lookout sighted a large 4-engine float plane dead ahead at an estimated range of 5 miles. 
                Cod submerged immediately. Seven minutes later, <strong>one bomb</strong> detonated close 
                enough to jar loose an electrical connection in the after torpedo room.
            </p>
            <p>
                Later that day, a lookout spotted a floating mine—round, with four horns visible, floating 
                two-thirds submerged and appearing fairly new. Cod took photographs, then attempted to 
                destroy it. <strong>.30 caliber carbine shots bounced off the mine's case</strong>; it took 
                .50 caliber fire to detonate it at 125 yards. Several pieces of spent shrapnel hit the boat.
            </p>
            <p>
                Less than an hour later, Cod <strong>struck a submerged object</strong>—the impact heard 
                throughout the boat, loudest in the forward torpedo room. The pit log was knocked out of 
                commission and the rod meter bent so badly the crew couldn't retrieve it with a chain fall. 
                They jettisoned it and installed a spare. In these heavily mined waters, the submerged 
                object may well have been a <strong>dud mine</strong> whose contact horns failed to 
                detonate—an extraordinarily lucky escape.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Memorial Service for President Roosevelt</h3>
            <div class="highlight info">
                On <strong>April 15, 1945</strong>, while submerged at periscope depth near Akuseki Jima, 
                Cod held a memorial service in the after battery for the late Franklin Delano Roosevelt. 
                The President had died three days earlier, and the crew paused operations to honor him 
                even while in enemy waters.
            </div>
            
            <h3>Hunting Mines by Moonlight (April 16)</h3>
            <p>
                On the night of <strong>April 16</strong>, a lookout and the OOD spotted a mine close 
                aboard to starboard, plainly visible in the <strong>moonstreak</strong>. Commander Adkins 
                stopped and began maneuvering to destroy it—a maneuver he noted was <em>"not as foolhardy 
                as it sounds."</em> By steering 170° to the left of the moon's azimuth, he knew the mine 
                was on his port hand and could always pull clear to the right.
            </p>
            <p>
                His plan: silhouette the mine in the moonlight and sink it with gunfire. The SJ radar 
                picked up the mine at 1,000 yards. But just as he maneuvered it into the moonstreak, 
                <strong>the moon became obscured by low clouds on the horizon</strong>. Cod resumed 
                course and speed, maneuvering to avoid floating objects in the darkness.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Gun Attack: Two Ships Sunk (April 17)</h3>
            <p>
                On <strong>April 17</strong>, Cod used her 5-inch gun to attack a floating mine—the first 
                two rounds were short, and the third was a dud that ricocheted off the water. They finished 
                it with a direct 40mm hit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Later that morning, lookouts spotted two ships in the haze. Tracking revealed one was 
                <strong>towing the other</strong>. Cod maneuvered to keep the armed tug masked by the tow, 
                then surfaced 3,750 yards astern and opened fire. At 3,200 yards, 5-inch rounds struck the 
                tow—an oiler carrying oil cargo. <em>"Great clouds of black smoke poured out and flames 
                roared forth as if from jets."</em> Cod shifted fire to the tug, hitting it as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aircraft forced Cod to break off and submerge, but both vessels were destroyed: the tug 
                <strong>CHOYO MARU</strong> (~2,000 tons) and the oiler <strong>BAISHI MARU</strong> 
                (~2,000 tons). Cod recovered survivors, gaining valuable intelligence about Japanese 
                shipping routes between Keelung and Shimonoseki.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Sampan (April 19)</h3>
            <p>
                On <strong>April 19</strong>, a lookout sighted a ship and Cod set battle stations, 
                closing to investigate. It turned out to be a fishing sampan. After firing a 40mm round 
                across her bow, Cod maneuvered alongside. It was a typical Chinese fishing boat—<em>"eyes 
                painted in the bow, oldest man at the tiller, youngest and smallest at the sculling oar, 
                one small boy hiding under the deck boards, lots of yammering."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Chief of the Boat boarded and found the sum of their cargo: one sack of beans, a 
                half-bushel of potatoes, and one fish. Cod gave the occupants <strong>five packages of 
                cigarettes</strong>, with which they were highly pleased. Pictures were taken.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The April 24-25 Torpedo Attacks</h3>
            <p>
                The patrol's major action came on the night of <strong>April 24-25</strong> in the Formosa Strait.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Attack #1: Under Fire (Night of April 24)</h4>
            <p>
                At 2130, the TDM picked up pinging. Cod closed to investigate and radar found two ships at 
                9,450 yards—both pinging at 15.6 kcs. Cod attacked on the surface, firing 4 torpedoes. All 
                ran erratically and missed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The target opened fire with its main battery. Shells splashed close—the nearest falling 
                <strong>40 yards from the bow</strong> and <strong>20 yards to starboard of the after engine 
                room hatch</strong>, splashing water on the bridge. Commander Adkins estimated the guns were 
                4.7-inch caliber from the <em>"deafening detonation."</em> The target then switched to machine 
                guns and tracers. <strong>The next day, the crew dug a lead slug out of the superstructure</strong>—they 
                had been hit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cod submerged and was <strong>depth charged</strong>, which knocked out the ST radar tuning.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Attack #2: The Kill (April 25)</h4>
            <p>
                At 0031, Cod came to periscope depth. The anti-submarine vessel lay 4,000 yards away, apparently 
                stopped. The crew made ready 3 torpedoes forward and 3 aft. As Ensign Wallace and RT1c Thomas 
                worked to repair the ST, the target began sweeping toward them, zigging 60° from side to side.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the range down to 3,500 yards and the ST back in commission, Cod fired. <strong>One torpedo 
                hit Minesweeper No. 41</strong>, which sank. Passing through the oil slick, the crew counted 
                <em>"78 heads... on one side only. There were more than this swimming. Most of them were shouting 
                and moaning in a melancholy manner."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Cod picked up one survivor—ALYEEMA, a 1st class petty officer from the engineering branch. He was 
                badly injured internally and confirmed the ship's identity.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Attack #3: Frustration (April 25)</h4>
            <p>
                Cod pursued the remaining two escorts, attacking on the surface with 6 torpedoes—3 at each target. 
                All ran erratically. No hits.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Torpedo Troubles</h3>
            <p>
                Of 16 torpedoes fired during this patrol, <strong>12 ran erratically</strong>. Post-attack analysis 
                and prisoner interrogation confirmed that many torpedoes were visibly broaching, porpoising, or 
                running in circles—a frustrating continuation of the torpedo problems that plagued earlier patrols.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Tragedy: Torpedo Fire and Man Overboard (April 26)</h3>
            <div class="highlight danger">
                At <strong>2135 on April 26</strong>, disaster struck. While taking readings on partially-withdrawn 
                Mark 18 torpedoes, the battery in torpedo No. 99264 (tube #8) exploded and caught fire. The after 
                torpedo room filled with dense, suffocating smoke. The smoke lungs were inadequate—only 3 men 
                with rescue breathing apparatus could enter to fight the blaze.
            </div>
            <p>
                With the warhead at risk of detonation, the Executive Officer requested permission to open the 
                after torpedo room hatch. <strong>FOLEY, L.E., QM2c</strong>, volunteered to go on deck to help 
                open the hatch. <strong>JOHNSON, A.G., S1c</strong>, coming up to stand lookout, was sent aft 
                to assist. <strong>A wave washed both men overboard. Johnson had no life jacket.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Lt. K.F. Beckman and torpedomen Krusenklaus and Grenner performed heroic acts—working 
                in intense heat and smoke, rigging jiggers to the red-hot torpedo, and holding their thumbs over 
                the hydrogen burner hole during firing—to eject the burning torpedo from the tube before the 
                warhead could explode.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cod searched through the night. A PBM seaplane from Okinawa arrived to help, dropping flares 
                and a life raft. The next morning, fighters and another PBM joined the search despite terrible 
                weather. The fighters offered to stay beyond their fuel limit; the CO later wrote: <em>"We felt 
                that we were being backed up by a pretty fine organization when these fliers came out in this 
                stinking weather to help us."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                At <strong>0520 on April 27</strong>, FOLEY was recovered—utterly exhausted but alive. He 
                reported that he had supported JOHNSON in the water for hours, but about two hours before 
                rescue, Johnson "said good-bye" and slipped under. <strong>Andrew G. Johnson, S1c, was never 
                found.</strong> On <strong>April 29</strong>, Cod conducted burial services for him.
            </p>
            <div class="highlight info">
                In his patrol report remarks, Commander Adkins wrote: <em>"ANDREW GORDON JOHNSON... was my 
                lookout, shipmate and friend. He died heroically in the line of duty, in order to save his 
                ship. The commanding officer derives no satisfaction from recording the events of the patrol... 
                The only satisfaction lies in recording the acts of heroism that were performed by JOHNSON, 
                and by his shipmates."</em>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Death of a Prisoner (April 28)</h3>
            <p>
                On <strong>April 28</strong>, the Japanese prisoner ALYEEMA died of <strong>acute peritonitis</strong>—likely 
                caused by internal injuries from a depth charge that had not been set to safe before his ship sank. 
                Cod held a <strong>funeral service</strong> for him, and he was buried at sea.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Hospital Ship and Night Coordination (May 2)</h3>
            <p>
                On the morning of <strong>May 2</strong>, a periscope sighting initially thought to be a sampan 
                rapidly developed into a <strong>properly marked hospital ship</strong> on a northerly course 
                at 14 knots—similar in appearance to TATUHARU MARU. Cod pulled off the ship's track into the sun 
                and watched her go by.
            </p>
            <p>
                That night, Cod tracked two radar contacts in darkness, rain, and overcast. After closing to 
                1,500 yards, they made out the sails of two junks—the same ones spotted earlier. No threat.
            </p>
            <p>
                Later that night, Cod raised a <strong>PBM flying boat from Okinawa</strong> on VHF. The plane 
                had also detected Cod's wolfpack partner Pompon on radar. When Cod reported the suspicious junks 
                to the south, the PBM flew off and <strong>illuminated them with flares</strong>, returning to 
                report they appeared friendly. The pilot offered to <strong>remain in the area most of the night</strong> 
                and to call on him if needed—a striking example of air-submarine coordination, made possible by 
                the capture of Okinawa just weeks earlier.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Trading with the Fishing Fleet (May 6)</h3>
            <p>
                On <strong>May 6</strong>, Cod had to run through a Chinese fishing fleet to retire their 
                scouting line. The crew decided to investigate—and see if they could pick up some fish.
            </p>
            <p>
                Firing 40mm warning shots across bows, they stopped several junks and sampans. Finding nothing 
                suspicious, they began trading: <strong>bread, canned goods, and cigarettes for fresh fish</strong>. 
                One batch turned out to be salt water eels—<em>"Very good."</em> Another batch had been drying 
                in the sun too long: <em>"we had to throw them over the side."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                That evening, Cod formed a scouting line with Pompon and resumed patrol.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Pink Periscope (May 8)</h3>
            <p>
                On <strong>May 8</strong>, while on periscope patrol off Haitan Island, Cod observed numerous 
                fishing sampans. Two of them spotted the periscope as they passed close aboard. One fisherman, 
                apparently thinking it was flotsam worth retrieving, decided to grab it—making <strong>two 
                passes at the scope</strong>, once with a boat hook and once with a man leaning out of the bow.
            </p>
            <p>
                Commander Adkins noted dryly: <em>"Our pink periscope camouflage is apparently better than I 
                had thought."</em> (U.S. submarines used pink paint on periscopes—related to "Mountbatten Pink"—believing 
                it helped them blend with the water and sky at dawn and dusk.)
            </p>
            
            <h3>Returning the Net (May 9)</h3>
            <p>
                On <strong>May 9</strong>, Cod surfaced to find a <strong>fishing net and line draped over the 
                boat</strong>—likely snagged while submerging through the fishing fleet. The crew bundled it up, 
                found the nearest sampan, and returned it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fisherman was overjoyed. Adkins noted: <em>"This was also the best gift we had made to any 
                Chinaman yet."</em> When Cod shoved off, the grateful fishermen <strong>chased them for several 
                minutes, attempting to give them fish</strong> in return.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Chasing the Will-o'-the-Wisp (May 16)</h3>
            <p>
                On <strong>May 16</strong>, the SJ radar picked up interference that the radar officer was 
                certain indicated a Japanese 10-centimeter radar. With fuel to spare, Adkins decided to chase 
                this <em>"will-o'-the-wisp."</em> After hours of maneuvering—including steaming in a square 
                in the middle of Formosa Strait—he concluded that the interference did not necessarily indicate 
                an enemy radar at all.

            <div class="highlight info">
                <strong>A Ham Radio Operator?</strong> Commander Adkins' analysis reveals unusual technical 
                sophistication: <em>"I believe that we have quite a bit to learn about skip distances, harmonics, 
                refraction, reflections, side lobes, back lobes, and general atmospheric conditions in connection 
                with this radar."</em> This is the vocabulary of an amateur radio enthusiast—suggesting Adkins 
                may have been a licensed "ham" before the war.

            <h3>Desperate to Board (May 17)</h3>
            <p>
                On <strong>May 17</strong>, Cod approached a junk—and <strong>four Chinese immediately jumped 
                aboard the submarine</strong>. When the crew directed the rest to man their sampan and come 
                alongside, they thought they were all being invited aboard and paddled over eagerly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The crew had to use <em>"threats with guns and main force"</em> to prevent more from boarding. 
                Getting all <strong>14 Chinese</strong> back into the sampan with their bags and baggage was 
                <em>"a feat of no mean suasion on the part of the Chief of the Boat."</em> Those on deck 
                <em>"went to their knees and protested while those who were in the sampan joined them in moaning 
                and sighing."</em> The sampan was taking water over the gunwales, though Adkins noted it 
                <em>"was in no danger of sinking."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                With a guard keeping the sampan's occupants in place with a carbine, the boarding party 
                searched the junk: a small amount of fish, 3 bags of rice, some papers, and a suitcase of 
                civilian clothes—nothing suspicious. Cod decided not to sink her. Before casting loose, they 
                gave the fishermen <strong>a gunny sack of canned food and a whole carton of cigarettes</strong>—which, 
                Adkins noted, <em>"should more than make up for the holes in their sails and the damage to 
                their halyards."</em>
            </p>
            
            <h3>Breaking Out the Colors (May 18)</h3>
            <p>
                On <strong>May 18</strong>, Cod set course north along the China coast to search by daylight 
                an area that had <em>"now become blind bombing by night"</em>—a testament to the intensity 
                of ongoing 5th Air Force raids on Formosa.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Cod approached junk #11704, the fishermen doused their sails in alarm. <em>"All hands 
                showed considerable alarm until we broke out the colors, at which the occupants smiled and 
                waved at us."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                That morning, orders arrived from ComSubPac: Cod was to rendezvous with <strong>USS Muskallunge</strong> 
                to transfer the PCO (Prospective Commanding Officer) from Cod to assume command of Muskallunge, 
                and to receive the <strong>sick CO of Muskallunge</strong> for evacuation to Guam.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Command Transfer at Sea (May 20-21)</h3>
            <p>
                On the night of <strong>May 20-21</strong>, in fairly heavy seas, Cod rendezvoused with Muskallunge. 
                To calm the water, Muskallunge pumped oil while Cod circled, spreading additional oil—including 
                5 gallons from the <em>"Forward Torpedo Room head."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                At 0040, <strong>Comdr. W.H. Lawrence</strong> climbed into a rubber boat with Lt. Hurst as coxswain 
                and set off across the oil slick to assume command of Muskallunge. The oil slick <em>"proved 
                reasonably effective in keeping the waves from breaking."</em> Lt. Hurst's chief difficulty, however, 
                was unexpected: <em>"the fish nudging him through the bottom of the boat."</em> He turned off his 
                light when this happened—but turned it back on when Cod started playing the searchlight.
            </p>
            <p>
                Muskallunge received Lawrence, then sent the rubber boat back with <strong>Lt. Comdr. L.A. Lajaunie Jr.</strong>, 
                her sick former commanding officer. Cod recovered the boat at 0150. Five minutes later, Muskallunge 
                departed on patrol and Cod set course for Guam.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Through the Eye of a Typhoon (May 21)</h3>
            <p>
                As Cod headed for Guam, the barometer began falling—dropping <strong>0.30 inches in one hour</strong>. 
                They were in the northeast quadrant of a cyclonic storm. At 1600, the barometer steadied at 29.60 
                inches, winds decreased, and for a brief period they experienced <em>"an almost calm sea with a 
                slight up and down movement and the sun shining overhead"</em>—they had passed through the 
                <strong>eye of the typhoon</strong>. By 1700, wind and sea picked up again from the southwest 
                as they cleared the storm center.
            </p>
            <p>
                That night, during transit of the Nansei Shoto, Cod contacted an <strong>Okinawa-based search plane</strong>. 
                After the pilot reported no targets, Cod warned him about the typhoon to the northwest. He replied 
                that he already knew—<em>"he had been flying around in it for the past 3 hours."</em>
            </p>
            <div class="highlight info">
                Commander Adkins reflected: <em>"I doubt that the American public will ever fully realise the 
                risk and hardships involved in the non-glamorous aspects of the air war."</em>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Return to Guam</h3>
            <p>
                Cod returned to Guam on May 29, 1945, having sunk Minesweeper No. 41, destroyed 11 floating 
                mines by gunfire, survived intense close-range combat, and suffered the tragic loss of 
                Seaman Johnson—the only crew member killed during Cod's seven war patrols.

        <section id="patrol7">
            <h2>Seventh War Patrol</h2>
            <div class="patrol-dates">June 26 – August 13, 1945 | Indo-China Coast & Gulf of Siam (Guam to Fremantle)</div>
            
            <p>
                Departing <strong>Guam on June 26, 1945</strong>, USS Cod's seventh and final war patrol, under 
                new commanding officer Lt. Comdr. E.M. Westbrook Jr., was a dramatic 49-day mission that culminated 
                in the war's end. It featured one of the most remarkable rescue operations in submarine history, 
                combat action, and a harrowing escape that left sailors stranded behind enemy lines.
            </p>
            <p>
                On <strong>July 1</strong>, after transiting the Batan Island Group, Cod reported for duty to 
                <strong>CTF 71</strong> (Commander Task Force 71) and received her assignment: patrol area off 
                the <strong>southeast Indo-China coast</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                On <strong>July 5</strong>, Cod rendezvoused with <strong>USS Besugo</strong> off Badai Bay. 
                Besugo shared what intel she had: <em>"she had been here three weeks and that the area was 
                dead."</em> The CO noted dryly: <em>"Encouraging news!"</em> Cod <em>"bid her farewell and 
                took up our lonely vigil."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                On <strong>July 7</strong>, Cod received orders from CTF 71 to proceed to <strong>Subic Bay</strong> 
                to refuel—a brief interruption before the patrol's most dramatic event.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Rescue of HNMS O-19 (July 8–10, 1945)</h3>
            <div class="highlight success">
                The defining event of Patrol 7 was the rescue of the Dutch submarine <strong>HNMS O-19</strong>, 
                which had run hard aground on <strong>Ladd Reef</strong> in the South China Sea. This remains 
                the <strong>only international submarine-to-submarine rescue in history</strong>.
            </div>
            <p>
                On <strong>July 8</strong>, en route to Subic Bay, Cod received orders to divert to Ladd Reef 
                at four-engine speed. Until contact was made, they didn't know the condition of O-19 or her crew. 
                Cod prepared for the worst: rubber boats, heaving lines, life rings, and rescue party topside; 
                <em>"dry clothes, empty bunks, hot soup and coffee below."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                O-19's captain, <strong>Lt. Comdr. J.F.D. van Hooff, RNN</strong>, hadn't lost his sense of humor. 
                He requested Cod approach at dawn to take towlines. When Cod replied they would see him at dawn, 
                van Hooff answered: <em>"We will certainly be here."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                On <strong>July 9</strong>, the towing attempts began. The current was <em>"really something"</em>—1.5 
                knots easterly. Maneuvering was <em>"ticklish cruising,"</em> trying to put Cod's bow within ten feet 
                of O-19's stern without running aground themselves. With the cable secured, both submarines backed 
                while O-19 <strong>fired her forward gun</strong>, <em>"making lots of smoke"</em>—using the recoil 
                to add extra backward thrust. But the second cable snapped. Cod took aboard 80 fathoms of chain 
                from O-19 and tried again.
            </p>
            <p>
                On <strong>July 10</strong>, at 1145, the last line parted. After <strong>eight hours yesterday and 
                six today</strong> with no progress, Adkins sent word to O-19: stand by to take off personnel. He wrote:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <em>"Felt almost as bad as the O-19 skipper at his having to abandon his ship. However, did not see 
                what more we could do."</em>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Cod had touched bottom forward herself <em>"at least once"</em> during the many approaches—Adkins 
                <em>"did not desire to have two submarines aground."</em> Their towing gear was <em>"makeshift,"</em> 
                and though the crew was <em>"willing and resourceful,"</em> they were <em>"inexperienced at rigging 
                for a tow."</em> And always, the specter: <em>"Jap planes and/or subs might have appeared at any 
                embarrassing moment."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                All <strong>56 Dutch officers and crew</strong> were evacuated to Cod. Then came the destruction:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Demolition charges</strong> went off with a muffled explosion, smoke pouring from the conning tower</li>
                <li><strong>Torpedo #5</strong> hit just abaft the conning tower—left a large hole but O-19 didn't budge</li>
                <li><strong>Torpedo #4</strong> struck the after torpedo room (containing two warheads)—<em>"terrific explosion. 
                    Stern gone, after part completely wrecked"</em></li>
                <li><strong>16 rounds from the 5-inch gun</strong> at 1,500 yards—16 hits, a dozen holes in her hull</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                What remained of O-19 stayed on the reef, listing and smoking heavily, but safe from Japanese capture. 
                Adkins noted ruefully that he wished his first torpedo had been fired at an enemy rather than an ally. 
                He <em>"could appreciate the captain's feelings as he silently watched his boat being destroyed."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                On <strong>July 13</strong>, Cod arrived at <strong>Subic Bay</strong>, escorted by USS <em>Rombach</em> (DE-364). 
                Mooring alongside USS <em>Anthedon</em>, she transferred the 56 O-19 personnel ashore, received fuel, 
                and effected minor voyage repairs before continuing her patrol.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Lucky Convoy (July 19-20)</h3>
            <p>
                On <strong>July 19</strong>, Cod received a contact report from USS <em>Hammerhead</em> on a convoy. 
                Racing to intercept, she took up position in a scouting line with <em>Hawkbill</em>. By mid-morning, 
                smoke was sighted—and with it, at least <strong>five aircraft</strong> providing air cover: float planes 
                and land-based fighters circling protectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                The convoy consisted of five ships: one oiler, three cargo vessels, a trawler escort, and a 
                <strong>Kamikaze-class destroyer</strong> patrolling aggressively up and down the flank, presenting 
                alternating 90° angles. At 1110, with the range down to 2,800 yards and a good firing solution, 
                <strong>depth charges began falling before Cod could fire</strong>. The scope dipped under; the approach 
                officer put in a sound bearing and fired three torpedoes at an AK. All missed—the target had been alerted 
                and maneuvered to avoid.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cod went deep to 150 feet in just 27 fathoms, rigging for depth charge. Over the next half hour, 
                <strong>18 depth charges</strong> fell—none too close. The patrol report later noted that a 
                <strong>six-degree temperature gradient between 80 and 100 feet</strong>—a thermocline that would 
                bend enemy sonar—<em>"proved very useful in evasion tactics that day."</em> When she came to 
                periscope depth, the destroyer and trawler were milling around 8,000 yards astern.
            </p>
            <p>
                That night, after unsuccessful attacks on the same convoy by USS <em>Brill</em> and USS <em>Bumper</em>, 
                Cod made an end-around to get ahead of the target. At 0310 on <strong>July 20</strong>, she was in 
                position—submerged, ready to fire bow tubes at the destroyer, then shift to stern tubes for the ships 
                on his beam. Visibility was poor in heavy rain squalls.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, at 0313: <em>"A wonderful thing has happened! Our radar just went out! Couldn't possibly have 
                picked a more critical moment."</em> An electrical fire in the SJ radar's main control unit had knocked 
                it out completely. Without radar, the attack was hopeless.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <em>"This was most discouraging, especially after having a second chance at this Jap. That KAMIKAZE 
                must carry a good luck charm or pray to his gods regularly. Today he has dodged torpedoes fired by 
                three submarines, requested and received a rain squall, and has cast a spell over our radar. 
                He hasn't been touched!"</em>
            </blockquote>
            
            <h3>The Junk-Sinking Campaign Begins (July 21)</h3>
            <p>
                With conventional targets scarce, Cod turned to disrupting the small-boat traffic carrying contraband 
                between Singapore and ports to the north. On <strong>July 21</strong>, after rendezvousing with 
                <em>Hammerhead</em>, Cod sighted her first target—a large junk, 131 tons, carrying rice.
            </p>
            <p>
                A single 40mm round fired ahead brought the junk to a halt. The crew of 12 <em>"crawled over the stern 
                fast"</em> into their lifeboat. A boarding party inspected the cargo and papers—the ship had recently 
                been in upkeep at Singapore. With the crew safely rowing toward shore four miles away, Cod opened fire: 
                <strong>7 rounds of 5-inch and 40 rounds of 40mm</strong> at 500 yards. The junk sank. It was the first 
                of what would become <strong>23 junks and motor sampans</strong> destroyed over the next twelve days.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Japanese noticed. Within the hour, a float plane (Rufe) appeared and <strong>dropped two bombs</strong> 
                as Cod dove. That evening, another aircraft made a run—swooping down with a zero angle on the bow. 
                Two more bombs, <em>"larger and/or closer than the other two earlier."</em> The CO noted dryly: 
                <em>"Nips apparently know we are here."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the attention, Cod rendezvoused with <em>Hawkbill</em> that night. The two submarines exchanged 
                Loran charts, wolf pack information—and <strong>movies</strong>.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Boarding Party Stranded (August 1)</h3>
            <div class="highlight danger">
                At 0830 on <strong>August 1</strong>, Cod came alongside a junk carrying army blankets, knapsacks, 
                and canvas tarpaulins. A boarding party went aboard to inspect. Fourteen minutes later, a fighter 
                plane appeared, headed straight for them.
            </div>
            <p>
                Cod dove as soon as topside was cleared—but <strong>one officer, four men, and their Chinese 
                interpreter</strong> were still aboard the junk. Before the CO started down the hatch, 
                <em>"a burst of machine gun fire was heard by all hands in the conning tower (as well as by 
                the COD and the C.O. on the bridge!)."</em> As Cod passed fifty feet, they heard bullets from 
                a <strong>second strafing run</strong> hitting the water above them. She leveled off at sixty 
                feet—the charted depth—and headed east, trying for fifteen fathoms.
            </p>
            <p>
                That evening at 1830, the Gunnery Officer dug a Japanese <strong>20mm slug</strong> out of the 
                superstructure. Inspection revealed evidence of <strong>10 or 12 hits</strong>. Cod had been 
                strafed, and the enemy had found his mark.
            </p>
            <p>
                As darkness fell, Cod began searching for her lost men. At 2003 she closed the beach to 
                investigate an anchored junk—but it wasn't theirs. At 2110 she began firing Very star flares 
                every ten minutes, hoping the signalman striker aboard would see them and flash back with 
                the flashlights the boarding party carried.
            </p>
            <p>
                By <strong>August 2</strong>, Blenny was coordinating the search. The CO took a creative approach: 
                finding an English-speaking native from a nearby junk, he sent the man ashore at a fishing village 
                to ask for information—holding the junk <em>"as insurance of his compliance."</em> At 2130, 
                800 yards from beach, they put the man over in the junk's lifeboat, which promptly swamped.
            </p>
            <p>
                That night, the CO's worry crept into the log: <em>"Until dark tonight there seemed to be little 
                doubt that we would at any moment find our missing shipmates. They were, individually, and as a 
                group, experienced, capable and full of common sense."</em> He noted they were well-armed—one 
                Thompson, one carbine, four pistols, and each man had a sheath knife. A pre-arranged rendezvous 
                point five miles south of Pulo Tenggol had been understood <em>"in case of just such an 
                occurrence."</em> Cod returned there after each search along the beach. <em>"Am now beginning 
                to be apprehensive,"</em> the CO admitted, <em>"and will try to calmly write down an 'estimate 
                of the situation'."</em>
            </p>
            <div class="highlight info">
                <strong>The CO's Estimate:</strong> He methodically worked through the possibilities. Ashore and 
                free? Unlikely—they would have signaled. Prisoners ashore? Unlikely—few Japanese in the area. 
                Aboard another vessel? Would have seen some sign. Still in the original junk? <em>"This is the 
                most logical assumption. Wind and current have been from south southwest and could carry them far. 
                It would be difficult, tedious and slow work to beat back south."</em> The worst case: the plane 
                had spotted them and sent an escort vessel to investigate. <em>"This is the worst possibility and, 
                unhappily, the second most logical."</em>
            </div>
            <p>
                At 1157 on <strong>August 3</strong>, Blenny's periscope spotted a large three-masted reddish-brown 
                junk near Pulo Kapas. The log records: <em>"Junk shows white patch on leech of mainsail in conformance 
                with description given by COD... Breathed a fervent prayer that this was it and not just a fancied 
                resemblance."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                At 1226, closing at flank speed: <em>"Can see junk is luffing up, can see people moving on deck, 
                can see something white moving about (the white dog COD described). Boy oh boy are we happy."</em> 
                A minute later, they had communication with the boarding party, who were <em>"anxious to make sure 
                we know who they are."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                By 1234, Blenny was alongside. The party came aboard: <strong>Lt.(jg) Franklin S. Kimball</strong> 
                (an old shipmate of Blenny's CO) in charge, plus Babick, McKnight, Tolle, Kinfroe, and <strong>See 
                Tone</strong>, the Chinese interpreter. <em>"All men were in perfect shape and considerably more 
                composed than most of our crew, who were outwardly exceedingly jubilant."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The log adds a touching detail: Blenny was so happy at finding the survivors that instead of 
                sinking the junk, they <em>"gave junk crew canned goods and fresh bread... in accordance with 
                sentiments of boarding party."</em> After <strong>48 hours</strong> adrift, all hands returned 
                in good health.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The "Francis Drake" Connection (August 3)</h3>
            <div class="highlight info">
                On the same morning the boarding party was rescued, Cod's log records a mysterious entry: 
                at <strong>0600 on August 3</strong>, Cod <em>"Received Lieutenant F.B.K. DRAKE, R.A.N.V.R. 
                as passenger, and 40 rounds of 40mm ammunition from BOARFISH."</em>
            </div>
            <p>
                Cod was originally supposed to rendezvous with <strong>USS Cobia</strong> to receive 
                Lt. Drake and ammunition. But as Blenny's patrol report reveals, Cod was completely 
                preoccupied with searching for her lost boarding party. At 0010 on August 2, Blenny's 
                CO—coordinating the search—<em>"told BOARFISH, who was much closer, to... rendezvous 
                with COBIA at a certain position at 0430 to receive Lieutenant Drake for COBIA and 
                40mm and 5" ammunition for me. BOARFISH, COBIA and COD receipted for message."</em> 
                The search for lost shipmates took priority over everything else.
            </p>
            <p>
                Boarfish's patrol report provides vivid details of the transfer. At 0340, Boarfish made contact 
                with Blenny and Cod. The initial plan was to transfer Lt. Drake and ammunition via 
                <strong>breeches buoy</strong>—a canvas seat resembling a pair of short trousers attached to 
                a life ring, suspended from a pulley riding on a line stretched between ships. It allowed 
                transfers without coming alongside, useful in rough seas or when maintaining distance was 
                preferable. But the equipment wasn't cooperating: <em>"constant binding of the block was 
                slowing down operations."</em> Boarfish asked Cod to simply come alongside instead. By 0555, 
                the transfer was complete: Lt. Drake and <strong>48 rounds of 40mm ammunition</strong>. 
                Cod got underway at 0601.
            </p>
            <p>
                But Boarfish wasn't done—Blenny had also requested <strong>5" ammunition</strong> for herself. 
                At 0622, Boarfish began rigging a breeches buoy to Blenny. At 0815, while ammunition was still 
                passing between the two submarines, an unidentified aircraft appeared at 15 miles. They 
                kept working. The plane headed north—<em>"agonizingly slowly he passed out of sight."</em> 
                Boarfish's log captures the tension: <em>"The man in the shears, standing by to butcher knife 
                the hawser, was fairly crying to perform."</em> That sailor was ready to cut the line at a 
                moment's notice if they needed to dive—but desperate not to abandon the transfer. At 0850, 
                the ammunition was finally across.
            </p>
            <p>
                This cryptic entry connects to a covert operation conducted by <strong>USS Cobia</strong>. 
                On <strong>July 27, 1945</strong>, Cobia landed a party on the west coast of Java consisting 
                of <strong>four Javanese Muslim commandos</strong> and their handler—Australian intelligence 
                officer <strong>Lieutenant (SP) Francis Bernard Kington Drake, R.A.N.V.R.</strong> 
                Remarkably, his name was genuine rather than a cover identity—he happened to share a name 
                with the famous Elizabethan naval raider.
            </p>
            <p>
                Drake was a member of <strong>Secret Intelligence Australia (SIA)</strong>—Section "B" of 
                the Allied Intelligence Bureau, a British unit that reported directly to MI6 in London. 
                SIA worked closely with Netherlands Forces Intelligence and specialized in covert operations 
                in the Dutch East Indies. Drake was later 
                <a href="https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/R1573758" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommended 
                for the Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE)</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The commandos remained ashore to conduct operations behind Japanese lines; their fate is unknown.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The "Kamikaze Convoy" (July 19-20)</h3>
            <p>
                Before the junk operations, Cod participated in a frustrating chase of a convoy that seemed 
                supernaturally lucky. After three submarines fired torpedoes at the convoy without success, 
                Cod's radar failed at the worst possible moment. The CO wrote with dark humor:
            </p>
            <div class="highlight info">
                <em>"A wonderful thing has happened! Our radar just went out! Couldn't possibly have picked 
                a more critical moment... That KAMIKAZE must carry a good luck charm or pray to his gods 
                regularly. Today he has dodged torpedoes fired by three submarines, requested and received 
                a rain squall, and has cast a spell over our radar. He hasn't been touched!"</em>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Junk Hunting in the Gulf of Siam (July 21 – August 1)</h3>
            <p>
                The bulk of Patrol 7's combat action consisted of 12 successive days of gun attacks on enemy 
                cargo-carrying junks and motor sampans in the <strong>Gulf of Siam</strong>, near Pulo Tenggol 
                off the coast of Malaya. Cod sank <strong>23 junks and motor sampans plus one oil barge</strong>, 
                totaling 2,200 tons of enemy cargo including rice, sugar, oil, crude rubber, and army supplies. 
                Boarding parties inspected each vessel, confiscated papers, and ensured native crews could safely 
                abandon ship before opening fire.
            </p>
            <p>
                On <strong>July 26</strong>, Cod took aboard a volunteer Chinese crew member named <strong>Thomas 
                See</strong>, who spoke English and lived in Singapore. He proved invaluable as an interpreter 
                during subsequent boardings, supplementing the Gunnery Officer's "dictionary-acquired linguistic 
                ability."
            </p>
            
            <h3>Dawn Raid with Blenny (July 27)</h3>
            <p>
                In a coordinated attack with USS Blenny, Cod approached an anchored fleet of 12 vessels at dawn 
                near Pulo Kapas. After firing .50 caliber bursts to wake native crews and allow them to abandon 
                ship, both submarines opened fire with 5-inch and 40mm guns—<strong>7 vessels confirmed sunk</strong> 
                between them. Throughout this period, Cod was <strong>bombed twice</strong> while diving after 
                sinking junks, with bombs landing progressively closer each time.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Rendezvous with USS Chub (August 7)</h3>
            <p>
                Enroute to Fremantle on <strong>August 7</strong>, Cod sighted a periscope at 1927 and exchanged 
                recognition signals with USS <strong>Chub</strong> (SS-329). Chub needed ammunition. By 2100, 
                Cod had rigged a breeches buoy for transfer—<em>"strictly a ship's force job"</em>—heading into 
                a force 3 sea on a steady course while Chub kept station 40-60 yards abeam. By 2232, they had 
                passed across <strong>35 rounds of 5-inch, 48 rounds of 40mm, movies, and mail</strong>. 
                <em>"Our jury-rig has worked fine."</em> At 2235, Cod bid Chub goodbye and set course for 
                Lombok Strait.
            </p>

            <h3>The War Is Over (August 11)</h3>
            <div class="highlight success">
                Two days out of Fremantle, Cod received the news: <strong>Japan had agreed to surrender</strong>. 
                Emperor Hirohito had accepted the Potsdam Declaration on August 10; word reached the fleet the 
                following day. As Commander Westbrook later recalled, they learned the war was over while still 
                at sea. Cod's seventh patrol would be her last combat mission.
            </div>
            
            <h3>End of Patrol</h3>
            <p>
                Cod arrived at <strong>Fremantle on August 13, 1945</strong>, ending her seventh and final war 
                patrol.
            <p>
                She would go on to serve in the peacetime Navy until 1954, later becoming a reserve 
                training vessel. Today, USS Cod is preserved as a <strong>National Historic Landmark</strong> 
                in Cleveland, Ohio—one of the best-preserved WWII fleet submarines in existence.

            These seven patrols established USS Cod's combat record during the most intensive period of the 
            Pacific submarine campaign. From a green boat on her first patrol to a battle-tested veteran, 
            Cod and her crew learned hard lessons about torpedo reliability, convoy tactics, and the art 
            of submarine warfare in contested waters.
